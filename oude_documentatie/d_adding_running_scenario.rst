Adding scenario information and running a simulation
========================================================


Before you can simulate your model you need to add scenario information. 
*A scenario holds information like the weather condition during a simulation, the total runtime of a simulation and laterals, breaches and initial conditions.* 

.. TODO: *For a general guide see :ref:`scenario_information`. <-verwijzen naar waar scenario information uitgelegd wordt.*

Adding scenario information and running a simulation can be done in :ref:`the Modeller Interface <simulate_api_qgis>` with the 3Di Models and Simulations plugin or on :ref:`the 3Di Live Site <simulate_w_live_site>`. 
You can run an interactive simulation on the Live Site. The Live Site will provide an insight while the scenario is running, when your simulation is finished you can download the results. 
When you use the Modeller Interface your results will only be provided after the simulation has finished. The Modeller Interface does provide a more detailed overview where you can enter your scenario information.
