What is the 3Di Live Site
==========================

You can load your organization's models and start simulations through version 2.0 of `the 3Di Live Site <https://www.3di.live/>`_. During the session, others can follow the simulations live, and interventions can be made in the model during the simulation. Results are presented in real-time. The following :ref:`sections <simulate_w_live_site>` describe all the steps, from adjusting the water input to viewing the calculation results.

For instructions on how to log in to the 3Di Live Site, refer to the :ref:`guide_to_portal`. For an overview of the session screen and tooling, refer to :ref:`overview_screen_ls`.

3Di Livesite
============
On the `Livesite <https://www.3di.live/>`_ you can start, pause and adjust your simulations. This is the key to interactive and visual modelling, which is essential for a shared understanding of watersystems.
A scientific paper on the importance of a shared understanding can be found `here <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285586163_Interactive_use_of_simulation_models_for_collaborative_knowledge_construction_-_The_case_of_flood_policy_decision-making>`_.

The video below gives a brief demo of the Livesite. For more detailed information, visit the :ref:`Livesite <guide_to_portal>` page.
