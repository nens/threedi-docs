Style guide
-----------
- Use British English
- If you make screenshots, make sure there are no real user names and real projects in the screenshots. Create them using a demo account or blur them.
- Headings use sentence case, i.e. starting with a capital letter, but other words not capitalized
- The following names are used for our user interfaces:
  - 3Di Live
  - 3Di Modeller Interface
  - 3Di Management
  - Scenario Archive
  
- Do not mix descriptive text ("Tool X can be used for purpose Y") and instructive text ("Click the icon in the upper right of the panel"). Put these in separate sentences or even separate paragraphs
- Use "Click *Play*" to indicate where a user should click. DO NOT USE: Click on *Play*, Click the play button, Click the PLAY button, Click the **PLAY** Button, Press Play, Press on Play, Press on the Play button, Select the play button, etc.

- Do not mention that something is 'new' in the docs, because that will require changes once it is no longer new. Explain how things work as if you are explaining it to new users that are not familiar with the 'old' situation.
- Native QGIS functionality does not need to be explained in the 3Di docs. Instead, refer to the QGIS documentation. In the URL, replace the version number (e.g. 3.28) by 'latest' (and check if it works).

- Avoid using dashes, e.g. write "2D boundaries" instead of "2D-boundaries"
- When mentioning a tool or section in the docs, use an actual reference. Write "use the tool :ref:`computational_grid_from_schematisation`", not "use the tool 'Computational grid from schematisation'"

Common spelling mistakes:

- Wrong: ground water. Right: groundwater.
- Wrong: timeseries. Right: time series.
- Wrong: time serie. Right: time series (also if it is a single time series!!).
