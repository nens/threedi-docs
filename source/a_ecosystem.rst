User interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can work with 3Di both in the browser and locally. We offer three user interfaces, each with their own specific strengths.

* :ref:`3Di Live <3di_live_introduction>`: run interactive simulations in the browser and follow them while they are running.

* :ref:`The 3Di Modeller Interface <mi_what_is>`: a desktop application for modelling experts and hydrologists, based on QGIS. Here you can build and edit schematisations, start simulations, and analyze results.

* :ref:`3Di Management <management_screens_what_is>`: manage online 3Di resources such as schematisations, models, simulation templates and simulations.

These three interfaces all interact with the 3Di server through the same :ref:`a_api`, a comprehensive *application programming interface*. You can use this API to interact with 3Di from a Python script or your own software product.

All components are secured by an **Authentication** and **Authorization** system, see :ref:`f_authentication_user_management`.
