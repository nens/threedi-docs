Modelling workflow
====================

Creating a new schematisation
--------------------------------------
3Di schematisations are created in the Modeller Interface and then uploaded to the server, where a 3Di model is generated from the schematisation.
For an in depth explanation on how to create a schematisation, refer to this :ref:`section <create_a_new_schematisation>`.

Editing a schematisation
--------------------------
A schematisation can be edited in the Modeller Interface. This is explained in this :ref:`section <view_and_edit_model>`.


You cannot edit your schematisation with the Live Site, but it is possible to temporarily adjust values of your model components. This is explained in this :ref:`section <editing_with_live_site>`.


Checking the schematisation
-----------------------------
Checking the quality of a schematisation can only be done with toolboxes in the Modeller Interface. For information how to use these toolboxes, please click :ref:`here <checking_model>`.


Uploading and downloading schematisations
------------------------------------------
Schematisations can be uploaded and downloaded in the Modeller Interface.
Schematisations can also be downloaded from??


Running a simulation
----------------------
Before you can simulate your model you need to add **scenario information**. A scenario holds information like the weather condition during a simulation, the total runtime of a simulation and laterals, breaches and initial conditions.

Adding scenario information and running a simulation can be done in  :ref:`the Modeller Interface <simulate_api_qgis>` with the 3Di Models and Simulations plugin or on :ref:`the 3Di Live Site <simulate_w_live_site>`. 

You can run an interactive simulation on the Live Site. The Live Site will provide an insight while the scenario is running, when your simulation is finished you can download the results. When you use the Modeller Interface your results will only be provided after the simulation has finished. The Modeller Interface does provide a more detailed overview where you can enter your scenario information.

Viewing, analyzing and storing results
----------------------------------------
Results can be viewed and analyzed with :ref:`the Modeller Interface <view_analyze_mi>`, :ref:`the Live Site <analyzing_livesite_running>` or :ref:`the Scenario Archive <scenario_archive>` in Lizard.


When using the Live Site you can :ref:`store <store_results_live_site>` the results.


Manage your schematisations and models
----------------------------------------
Managing your schematisations and models can be done with :ref:`the Management Portal <management_screens_manual>`.
