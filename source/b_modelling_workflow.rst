Modelling workflow
====================

Creating a new schematisation
--------------------------------------
3Di schematisations are created in the Modeller Interface and then uploaded to the server, where a 3Di model is generated from the schematisation.
For an in-depth explanation on how to create a schematisation, refer to this :ref:`section <create_a_new_schematisation>`.

Editing a schematisation
--------------------------
A schematisation can be edited in the Modeller Interface. This is explained in this :ref:`section <edit_schematisation>`.


You cannot edit your schematisation with 3Di Live, but it is possible to temporarily adjust values of your model components. This is explained in this :ref:`section <3di_live_interactive_tools>`.


Checking the schematisation
-----------------------------
Checking the quality of a schematisation can be done in the Modeller Interface. For information how to do this, see :ref:`checking_model`.


Uploading and downloading schematisations
------------------------------------------
Schematisations can be uploaded and downloaded in the Modeller Interface.


Running a simulation
----------------------
Before you can simulate your model you need to add *scenario information*. A scenario holds information like the weather condition during a simulation, the total runtime of a simulation and information about laterals, breaches and initial conditions.

Adding scenario information and running a simulation can be done in  :ref:`the Modeller Interface <simulate_api_qgis>` with the 3Di Models and Simulations plugin or on :ref:`3Di Live <3di_live_sessions>`. 

You can run an interactive simulation on 3Di Live. 3Di Live provides the opportunity to see the results of your simulation as it is running. When your simulation is finished you can store and subsequently download the results. When you use the Modeller Interface your results will only be provided after the simulation has finished. The Modeller Interface does provide a more detailed overview where you can enter your scenario information.


Downloading results
-------------------
Simulation results can be downloaded with the Modeller Interface (see :ref:`mi_download_res`)

Viewing, analyzing and storing results
----------------------------------------
Results can be viewed and analyzed with :ref:`3di_results_manager`, :ref:`3Di Live  <3di_live_analysis_tools>` or :ref:`the Scenario Archive <scenario_archive>` in Lizard.

When using 3Di Live you can :ref:`store <store_results>` the results.


Manage your schematisations and models
----------------------------------------
Managing your schematisations and models can be done with :ref:`3Di Management <management_screens_manual>`.
