================

On this page an overview of all settings objects is provided.

.. _global_settings:

Global settings
---------------

The global settings of your schematisation. These can be grouped into categories: *General*, *Grid*, *Terrain information*, *Time*, *Settings id's*, *Extra options 1D*, and *Extra options 2D*.

Global settings attributes

.. todo::
	- Check if everything is correct in this table?
	- Is this still relevant: use_2d_rain
	- Same for nr_timesteps? This doesn't do anything anymore, correct? It is still mandatory to give a value for this?
	- I also don't think startdate and starttime still work.. The default is 01/01/2000, 12:00 I think and is used when starting a simulation.
	- Same for dem_obstacle_detection and dem_obstacle_height.
	
	- No idea what guess_dams does and whether it (still) works.
	- Technical documentation on maximum table step size is missing in h_subgrid.rst.
	- For the initial groundwater and initial waterlevel types the type is integer, but that is not shown in the QGIS-table. I think it should be as the frict_type. Because then it makes sense that it is an integer type.
	- Add documentation for the folder structure that 3Di uses.

		- "Wet surface" should be "Wet surface area"
		- "Volum" should be "Volume"
		- Not sure, but I think "Surface source sink discharge" should be "Surface source & sink discharge"

Groundwater settings
--------------------

Settings for groundwater models. For more information on groundwater, see :ref:`groundwater`.

Groundwater settings attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Todo::
	- Why is the equilibrium_infiltration_rate_type, the only value that is mandatory (at least according tot he Schematisation-editor) other than the global values.
	- Also the display_name is mandatory. Some settings tables have a mandatory display_name, for others it's not mandatory. This seems rather strange.

Interflow settings

Interflow can be used as an extra layer below the surface. For more information on Interflow, see :ref:`interflow`.

.. Todo::
	- Feedback: I noticed that order of attributes for the Hydraulic conductivity is first the file, then the global value. This is the same in the global-settings, but different in the simple infiltration settings, where the order is first a global value or a raster-file. It's a small thing, but would be better to have it the same across all tables.
	- In the interflow types, the correct spelling is "point-scaled" instead of "point scaled".

.. _numerical_settings:

Numerical settings

Most users do not need to worry about these settings. More advanced users can change the default settings to improve their models. These can be grouped into categories: *General*, *Limiters*, *Matrix*, *Time*, *Thresholds*, *Miscellaneous*. For more information on the numerical settings, see :ref:`numerics`.

.. todo::
	- check whether the descriptions are actually correct. Some of them were quite difficult to deduce from the documentation (https://docs.3di.live/h_simulation_settings.html).
	- there are typos in the drop-down menu for use_of_nested_newton in the Schematisation-editor: there is a space too much between "schematisation" and "includes" and "closed profiles" should be without a hyphen.
	- Minimum surface area is explained nowhere, so I made up my own interpretation of it. This should be checked to make sure it is correct.
	- The discription in the drop-down menu for use_of_nested_newton is a little confusing. It makes more sense to first describe the model and then the required value. This also prevents the problem with this weird description: "70 for 1D, 2D surface and groundwater flow or higher", which should be "1D, 2D surface and groundwater flow: 70 (or higher)".

.. _vegetation_drag:

Vegetation drag settings
------------------------

The *vegetation drag* table contains the input parameters that are used for 2D flow with vegetation. For an in-depth explanation of how 2D flow with vegetation is calculated by 3Di, see :ref:`flow_with_vegetation`. For more information on using vegetation in your 3Di model and choosing the right parameter values, see :ref:`a_how_to_vegetation`.

Vegetation drag can only be used with friction type 'Chezy', because the vegetation formulation (initially introduced by :cite:p:`Baptist2007`) uses Chezy.

.. Todo::
	- I'm not sure which settings are mandatory. These should be checked first. I've now stated that all global values are mandatory and all rasters as optional (as well as the display_name).
	- I've properly included a citation and refered to the paper (and changed "Baptist 2005" to "Baptist, 2007" because, judging by the title of the paper "On inducing equations for vegetation resistance", this is the proper paper). However, this should be checked.
