*after running scenario and saving results, see :ref:`store_results_live_site`.
you can also analyze model while the scenario is still running*

1D network
----------

Channels and structures can be included as 1D elements in the model. The channels show the direction of flow with the help of moving points. The direction and speed are based on the flow velocity in the channel. The different sizes of the points are based on thhe discharge. The results (discharge, water level, waterdepth and flow velocity) are available at the structures by selecting them.

Discharge and velocity are in the lines:

And water level and water depth are in the nodes:

It is also possible to adapt some properties of structures during the calculation. This includes among others the closing of a culvert or increasing the pumping capacity.
