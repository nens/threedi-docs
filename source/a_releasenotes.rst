3Di general releases
--------------------

January 8th, 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Water quality**

We are proud to announce that we have added water quality capabilities to 3Di. More specifically, you can introduce concentrations of substances to the simulation, and compute the spread of substance concentrations due to advective forces and (numerical) diffusion.

- Substances can enter the model domain as concentrations in initial water, boundary conditions, laterals, rain, leakage, surface sources and sinks. This applies to the entire model domain (1D, 2D, and groundwater).

- Each forcing can contain concentrations of multiple substances at the same time

- The substance concentration input mirrors the input of the forcing. I.e. 2D initial water levels are supplied as a raster, so 2D initial substance concentrations are also supplied as a raster; substance concentrations in time series rain is also to be provided as a time series; et cetera.

- Substances can have names set by userÂ 

- Output is in NetCDF format. The file has the same structure as hydrodynamic results (results_3di.nc) and can be read with ``threedigrid``.

- The logging includes a substance summary (similar to the flow summary) in JSON format

.. note:
	
	- Input is purely API based (no GUI) 
    
	- Multiple laterals cannot be added to a single computational cell
	
	- All substances are known at the start of the simulation, although amounts can be set to 0.0 [g/m3,?].

**Other improvements and bugfixes**

- Memory efficiency in the generation of 3Di models has been improved. The limit for the DEM size is now 5 billion pixels (including NODATA pixels) (threedigrid-builder #345)

- The flow summary is now JSON format instead text (.log). Units and values are split

- Simulation ID is included in the flow summary (threedi-api #1303)

- Timestep reduction and matrix instability logging are no longer included in simulation.log, because this information is already available in matrix.log and timestep_reduction.log (threedi-calculationcore #674)

- The damage estimation (Netherlands only) now uses the newest land cover raster available in Lizard

- Bugfix: cross-sectional area of groundwater flow made correct on the transitions of the grid size and in case water rises above the bed level. (threedi-calculationcore #708) 

- Bugfix: several small bugfixes for structure control 

- Bugfix: DEM edits in models with interflow would crash the simulation

- Bugfix in ``threedigrid`` for 3Di models with boundary conditions. Time series of some variables did not have the correct ordering (i.e. wrong time series for node or flowline). This applies to ``infiltration_rate_simple``, ``ucx``, ``ucy``, ``leak``, ``intercepted_volume``, ``q_sss`` for Nodes and ``qp``, ``up1``, ``breach_depth``, ``breach_width`` for Lines.


October 31st, 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Structure controls can now set the gate level, see :ref:`controlling_gate_level`. (threedi-api #2016)

- If generating a 3Di model takes more than 24 h, the process is automatically cancelled (threedi-api #1992)

- Timestep reduction and matrix instability logging are no longer included in simulation.log, to avoid duplication with timestep_reduction.log and matrix.log (threedi-calculationcore #674)

October 2nd, 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Bugfix: More memory is made available for generating 3Di models, to fix a performance degradation that was experienced when generating very large models (threedi-api #2005)

- Bugfix: DEM edits would crash the simulation if the edit polygon covers more than one DEM tile (threedi-tables #262)


September 21th, 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- It has been made easier to :ref:`howto_clip_schematisations`.

- Culverts can be imported into the schematisation with the new :ref:`Vector data importer<vector_data_importer>`.

- The :ref:`conveyance_method` can now be used, for more accurate calculation of friction in 1D open water. For this new feature, the following checks where added to the schematisation checker.
     
	- Check 26: make sure friction types with conveyance are only used on v2_cross_section_location
	
	- Check 27: make sure friction types with conveyance are only used on tabulated rectangle, tabulated trapezium, or tabulated yz shapes.
	
	- Check 28: make sure cross-sections with conveyance friction monotonically increase in width
	
	- Check 29: advice to use friction with conveyance on cross-sections where it is possible, has not been used.
	
- The schematisation page in 3Di Management has been revised.

- Schematisation-level description can be added in 3Di Management

- In 3Di Management, many properties of online resources have been made editable: schematisation names, schematisation descriptions, schematisation tags, commit messages, 3Di model names, simulation template names.

- It has become easier to delete revisions and schematisations. When a revision is deleted, its 3Di Model is also automatically deleted. When a schematisation is deleted, its revisions are also automatically deleted.

- In the 3Di Modeller Interface, a new page for generating :ref:`saved_states` was added to the 3Di Models & Simulations simulation wizard.

For further details see the release notes for :ref:`3Di Modeller Interface<release_notes_mi_20230921>` and :ref:`3Di Management<3di_ms_release_20230921>`

.. note::
   3Di Toolbox will be replaced by 3Di Results Analysis on October 1st, 2023. See :ref:`transition_from_3di_toolbox`.

August 7, 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Interflow can now be combined with limiters

- The 3Di computational core now writes the actions resulting from structure controls to a file (structure_control_actions_3di.nc), which can be downloaded via the API. Functionality in threedigrid and the 3Di Modeller Interface will be released in Q4 2023 or Q1 2024.

July 18th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released several new features, improvements and bugfixes. Most notably:

- Storage in the groundwater domain is more accurate and less cell size dependent because it uses subgrid

- Simulation templates are inherited from the 3Di Model of the previous revision and persist when the 3Di Model is regenerated.

- User management is now available on management.3di.live (if you have Manager rights)

- If you have run a simulation but forgot to include Lizard postprocessing, you can now start it after the simulation has finished.


For more details, see the :ref:`release notes for the 3Di API<3di_api_release_20231807>`, :ref:`release notes for the 3Di computational core<3di_calccore_release_20231807>`, and :ref:`release notes for 3Di Management core<3di_ms_release_20231807>`

April 25th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**3Di Live**

- Breaches: a line has been added to the visualisation of breaches in 3Di Live. Discharge and flow velocity are visualized on these lines by moving dots.

**Schematisation checker**

*New checks*

Several checks have been added.

- Add INFO 109 and 110: the bottom level of a manhole cannot be higher than the reference level of the closest cross-section of any channel it is connected to. threedigrid-builder automatically fixes this, hence info instead of warning.

- Add WARNING 108: the crest_level of a weir or orifice cannot be lower than the bottom_level of any manhole it is connected to.

- Add ERROR 326: this gives an info message if a record exists in the simple_infiltration table, but is not referenced from the global settings.

- Add ERROR 66: this raises a warning if a pumpstation empties its storage area in less than one timestep.

- Add ERROR 1205 to make sure that a timeseries is not an empty string.

- Add ERROR 1206 to confirm that the timesteps in all boundary condition timesteps are the same.

*Beta features*

The 3Di spatialite now supports *beta* tables, fields, and values. These are used for test purposes, and will become available to all users once testing has been completed.

- Added ERROR 1300: If a user puts a non-null value in a column marked as beta in threedi-schema, this will be reported by the schematisation checker.

- Added ERROR 73: groundwater boundaries are allowed only when there is groundwater hydraulic conductivity.

- Added ERROR 74: groundwater boundary types are not allowed on 1D boundary conditions.

- Added groundwater 1D2D range checks for manholes, channels, and pipes for exchange_thickness, hydraulic_conductivity_in, and hydraulic_conductivity_out.

- Add ERRORs and WARNINGs for vegetation_drag input. Both rasters and global values.

**Models & Simulations API**

- Added support for uploading additional initial water levels to an existing 3Di models. Both 1D and 2D are supported.

- Added support for uploading and downloading computational grid Geopackage files for 3Di models.

- Bugfix: We have made the use of Lizard raster rain in a simulation more robust by using longer retries getting data from Lizard.

- The duration of a constant wind event can now be patched while the simulation is paused.

- In the near future an extra log file (scheduler.log) will be added to log files in the downloadable ZIP file. The scheduler log file is intended for 3Di developers to identify problems when simulations have crashed.


**Computational grid**

- Channels with calculation type *connected* or *double connected* can now be placed outside the DEM, as long as they connect to a location where a 2D cell is present. If a 'potential breach' or 'exchange line' is used to set the location to which the calculation node connects, the location of those features determines whether an error is raised. If a channel with calculation type connected is outside of the DEM, but the closest point on its exchange_line is on the DEM, the computional grid can be built and the 3Di model is valid.

- 1D-2D links that cross an obstacle will take the exchange level from the obstacle

**Authorisation**

- The former SSO configuration has been removed. Username/passwords are now only accepted if they have a Personal API Key that was migrated earlier.

.. - Version included in release



February 24th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hotfix:

- In rare cases the DEM edit was crashing. This is fixed


February 10th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hotfix:

- Fixed CRS comparison in table generation (threedi-tables 3.0.5).
- Sources & sinks Lizard raster source did dot work due to problem with internal *LizardRasterSourcesSinks* serialization/deserialization.
- Max time step set to NULL is allowed 


February 6th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released the following features:

- Support to :ref:`import_gwsw_hydx`
- Eased restrictions on rasters 
- User friendly breaches editing. Also added the ability to name them and keep breaches persistent throughout revisions, model changes and calculation grid changes. 
- :ref:`Boundary conditions timeseries can be uploaded as CSV files <simulate_api_qgis_boundary_conditions>`, so it is no longer needed to make a new revision when you want to use different boundary conditions. 
- Structure control can be set by uploading a JSON file


January 3rd 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hotfix:

- Correct use of offset for timed control structures

December 16th 2022
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hotfix:

- Fixed saved states using interception

December 6th 2022
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hotfix:

- Fixed obstacle edits for models with maximum infiltration capacity raster

November 21th 2022
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Tables**

When generating the subgrid tables the approach has changed. Instead of user defined equidistant steps 3Di now takes non equidistant steps. This saves a ton of space when generating 3Di models and is especially of impact when modelling in hilly areas or in areas where there is a large difference between pixels.

.. image:: /image/subgrid_tables_non_equidistant_steps.png
   :alt: Showing the difference between equidistant and non equidistant steps.

*DEM edits*

.. _klondike_release:

January 31st 2022 (Klondike)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On January 31st we have released the backend for the Klondike release. In this release we introduce a brand new route to process schematisations into 3Di models. This will replace the process known as 'inpy'.
For users that have not been migrated yet, this will not have effect on their work process. 3Di Models will simulate as before.

The migration will be rolled out gradually, users will be contacted for this. 3Di Management is available for all users right away, but keep in mind that the new features mostly work on migrated schematisations and 3Di Models.
Contact our servicedesk if you have any questions regarding migration.

We use the following definitions:

- Simulation templates
- Schematisations
- 3Di Models

**Simulation templates**

Simulations can be started up using a simulation template. A simulation template can be seen as a pre-defined setup of a simulation. It can contain:

- initial water level rasters
- control structures
- dry weather flow patterns
- lateral inflow
- time series of boundary conditions
- simulation settings (Aggregation settings, Numerical settings*, Physical Settings*, Time step settings*)

**3Di Model**

A 3Di Model is generated from a schematisation. The generation takes the grid & table settings from the spatialite and processes the schematisation into a 3Di Model.


**3Di Management Screens**

3Di Management has been extended with a Models section. In this Models section users can:

For 3Di Models

- See an overview of Models in a list
- See an overview of Models in the map
- Per Model a detailed page is available including the location on the map, size of the Model.
- Per Model is an option to run the simulation on 3Di Live
- On the detailed Model page there is an option to run the simulation on 3Di Live
- On the detailed Model page there is an option to delete the model
- On the detailed Model page there is an option to re-generate the model from the schematisation
- A history of simulations performed with the 3Di Model
- An overview of available simulation templates. By default 1 simulation template is available for every Model. This is generated based on the spatialite. The name of the simulation template is the name in the v2_global_settings table.

For schematisations users can:

- See all available schematisations in a list.
- See past revisions of a schematisation
- Generate a 3Di Model from a schematisation or re-generate an existing model from the schematisation. Keep in mind that doing so will remove additionally generated templates

- The 'cross-section' stylings for Culvert, Cross-section location, Orifice, Pipe, and Weir have been re-implemented. Some bugs were fixed and support for recently introduced cross-section shapes was added. The stylings are now based on custom expressions, that can also be used for other purposes in any QGIS expression (#96)


*1D2D exchange*

- Add processing algorithm 'Generate exchange lines' (#93, #131)


*Database schema*

- Compatibility with schema 216 (#451).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**3Di Models & Simulations v3.4.4**

- Bugfix: after installing the 3Di Modeller Interface with installer version 3.28.5-1-3 or higher, installing the 3Di Models & Simulations plugin in a new user profile would fail. This was fixed (#454)

- Bugfix: Simulation template is now created if this option is checked in the simulation wizard; this was broken since version 3.4 (#447)

**3Di Modeller Interface installer 3.28.4-2-1**

- Add option to install for all users. Especially useful for system administrators.

- New user profiles use the 3Di default settings.

March 10th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**3Di Models & Simulations v3.4.3**

- Bugfix: dialog "Remove excess 3Di models" sometimes did not pop up, even though the maximum model count for the given schematisation and/or organisation had been reached. This has been fixed now.

**3Di Modeller Interface installer 3.28.4-2-1**

- The 3Di Modeller Interface is now based on QGIS 3.28, which became the Long-Term Release (LTR) in March 2023

- Installing a 3Di User Profile is now optional; if a user profile called 'default' already exists, installing a new one (overwriting it) is opt-in.

- Installing the 3Di Modeller Interface is now optional (i.e. you can also use the installer to install a user profile only)

- The name of the app is now "3Di Modeller Interface 3.28" instead of "3DiModellerInterface3.28"


February 6th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**3Di Toolbox v2.5.0**

A new processing tool is introduced:

- Import GWSW HydX files to a 3Di Spatialite, including the possibility to download it directly from the server

The 'Commands' toolbox has been removed, and tools that are still relevant have been deleted or moved to the QGIS native Processing Toolbox (#715):

- 'Raster checker' has been removed, as it has been integrated into Schematisation Checker (#710). Most checks in the raster checker are no longer relevant, because 3Di can now handle most of these cases.
- 'Schematisation checker' is available from the Processing Toolbox > 3Di > Schematisation
- 'Create breach locations', 'Add connected points' and 'Predict calc points' have been removed. These are no longer compatible with the latest sqlite schema version (214), where v2_connected_pnt, v2_calculation_point and v2_levee where replaced by v2_exchange_line and v2_potential_breach. Please use the 3Di Schematisation Editor for schematising breaches and/or setting the 2D cell with which 'connected' channels connect.
- 'Import SufHyd' is available from the Processing Toolbox > 3Di > Schematisation
- 'Guess indicators' is available from the Processing Toolbox > 3Di > Schematisation
- 'Control structures' has been removed. Please fill the spatialite tables directly or upload a JSON file through the Simulation Wizard to use structure control.

Other improvements:

- Processing algorithm 'Computational grid from schematisation' no longer remembers the input parameters from previous uses, because this was confusing (#723)

**3Di Schematisation Editor v1.3**

- You can now add 'Exchange lines' to your schematisation to set the 2D cells with which a Channel should make 1D2D connections (#92)
- You can now add 'Potential breaches' to your schematisation by drawing a line starting from a connected channel (#92)
- Bugfix: editing attributes of referenced, not yet committed features (e.g. the connection node of a new manhole) now works without issues. #107

**3Di Models & Simulations v3.4**

The simulation wizard has been improved and some important additions have been made:

- Boundary conditions timeseries can be uploaded as CSV files, so it is no longer needed to make a new revision when you want to use different boundary conditions. (#134)
- Structure control can be set by uploading a JSON file (#313)
- Upon completion of the simulation wizard, all data for the starting the simulation is sent to the 3Di API. This upload now happens in the background, so that you can continue working while the simulation is starting. (#389)
- Because of this, the upload timeout can be set to a much higher value; please change this yourself if you after upgrading to the new version. The default upload timeout has been set to 15 minutes (#216). This is relevant when your simulation includes large files, such as laterals, dry weather flow, or 2D initial conditions.
- Progress through the steps of the simulation wizard has been improved to only include the steps that you included in the 'options' screen before starting the simulation wizard. (#262)
- The "Options" dialog that is shown before starting the simulation wizard has been reordered and clearly shows which options are available to the 3Di model you have chosen. (#261)
- "Post-processing in Lizard" now has its own page in the simulation wizard. #432
- Invalid parameter values for damage estimations (repair times of 0 hours) can no longer be chosen. #104
- Forcings and events that cannot (yet) be added to a simulation through the simulation wizard, will now be preserved if they are part of the simulation template (#316). This applies to the following forcings and events:

  - Raster edits 
  - Obstacle edits
  - Local or Lizard time series rain
- When selecting a breach, the breach's code and display name are shown on the map along with the id. 


The schematisation checker in the "Upload new revision" wizard has been improved in the following ways:

- The raster checker has been integrated in the schematisation checker (#412). Most checks in the raster checker are no longer relevant, because 3Di can now handle most of these cases.
- You can now export schematisation checker results to a CSV file (#230)

Other changes and bugfixes:

- The minimum friction velocity in new schematisations now defaults to 0.005 instead of 0.05 (#411)
- A newer version (4.1.1) of the python package threedi-api-client is now used (#417)
- If the maximum number of 3Di models for your organisation has been reached, a popup will allow you to delete one or more of them before uploading a new revision (#367)
- Bugfix: in some cases, schematisation revisions could not be downloaded if "Generate 3Di model" had failed for that revision (#428)
- Bugfix: prevent python error when attempting to start the simulation wizard with a template that has NULL as maximum_time_step value #418


December 8th 2022
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**3Di Toolbox v2.4.1**

Due to changes introduced in v2.4, threedi-modelchecker would re-install on every startup. This has been fixed now. (#729)
Fixed 'Import sufhyd': this routine expected the table v2_pipe to have a column 'pipe_quality', which was removed recently (#728)
A schema version check was added to 'Import sufhyd'. If the target spatialite has a too low schema version, you will be instructed to migrate it and try again (#726)

*Postprocessing Lizard*

- Added the possibility to use the projects in Lizard directly. Give your simulation as a tag: âproject:numberâ and the number will be added in lizard to the project.

*Reminder*

- The server known as inpy is no more. If you started using 3Di this year you can ignore this message. For the other users: the 3Di models cannot run anymore on 3Di Live. But the schematisations are all available. The be able to run the 3Di model again, simply look for your schematisation on management.3di.live and press âgenerate modelâ.

- If youâre not sure whether your model is generated using inpy, go to management.3di.live search for your model. If there is no details page available (link is greyed out) then the model is generated via inpy.


August 2022
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Documentation on the Watershed Tool can be found `here <https://github.com/nens/threedi-network-analyst#user-manual>`_.


*3Di Schematisation Editor v1.1.1 - EXPERIMENTAL*

- Migrating spatialites to the newest schema version now follows the same logic in all plugins: if a migration is required, a popup message will ask you if you want this. If you click Yes, migration will be performed immediately. (#50)


*3Di Schematisation Editor v1.1 - EXPERIMENTAL*

This is a new plugin that will make editing schematisations much easier than before.

What does this plugin have to offer for modellers?

- Directly edit all layers of your schematisation, using all native QGIS functionality for editing vector features
- Quickly add features to your schematisation with the "magic" editing functionality for 1D layers. For example: existing connection nodes are used when drawing a pipe between them, new connection nodes and manholes are created when a new pipe is digitized, etc.
- Easily move nodes and all connected lines using the smartly pre-configured snapping and topological editing settings
- Easily move the start or end of pipes, channels, culverts, orifices, weirs, pumps, and the connection node id's will be automatically updated for you
- Get a complete overview of your schematisation: all rasters that are part of your schematisation are added to the QGIS project when the schematisation is loaded
- Spot the tiniest local variation in elevation with the hillshade layer is automatically added on top of your DEM
- Visualise the mapping of (impervious) surfaces to connection nodes and change them by updating the geometries
- Easily navigate through your schematisation: layers in the layer panel are neatly grouped together in collapsed groups

Version 1.1 is 'experimental' plugin, because it is not yet fully integrated with the other components of the Modeller Interface. In practice, this mainly means that you will have to convert between the Spatialite and the Schematisation Editor's Geopackage format every time you start or finish editing your schematisation.

New in version 1.1 (for those users who already tried out version 1.0):

- Facilitate adding channels and cross section locations (also fixes the issue that sometimes it was not possible to fill in channel start or end node ids)
- Delete referencing features
- Release through plugins.3di.live as experimental plugin
- Rename to 3Di Schematisation Editor
- Set scale dependent visibility for manholes
- Fix export to spatialite in QGIS 3.22 (was fixed by adding a schema migration in threedi-modelchecker)
- Fix drawing of pipe trajectory over existing manholes
- Consistent handling of geometry edits
- Check write permissions for Geopackage target location
- Support spatialite schema_version 206 + updated the popup message if schema is not up to date
- Remove field cross_section_code
- Remove table cross_section_definition
- Make all id fields autoincrement
- End all editing sessions when user clicks Save to Spatialite
- Rename column calculation_pnt_id of connected_point to calculation_point_id
- Pump capacity should be NULL by default
- Add geopackage database connection to QGIS list
- Refresh map canvas after removing 3Di model
- Correct list of calculation types in culvert attribute form
- Guarantee that layers are added to the correct group
- Add hillshade styled DEM
- Raster styling classes
- Hide 'fid' columns
- More intuitive validation color logic in attribute forms
- Make snapping work properly after saving/loading project
- Fix scale dependent visibility for manholes
- Rename plugin to 3Di Schematisation Editor
- Fix width and diameter labels for tabulated cross sections
- Compatibility with QGIS 3.22 / Spatialite v4.3
- Drop-downs are used in the attribute table for fields with a limited list of valid integer values (e.g. calculation type).

*3Di Toolbox v2.1*

- IMPORTANT: If you update to 3Di Toolbox v2.1, you also _must_ update the 3Di Models & Simulations plugin to version 3.1. Failing to do so may lead to unexpected behaviour of several tools.
- Fix several issues with 3Di Spatialites in QGIS 3.22. Until now, all 3Di Spatialites were built using Spatialite 3, which QGIS 3.22 no longer supports. Migrate Spatialite now tranfers all data to a Spatialite 4.3 file.
- Graph Tool and Water Balance Tool plots now render properly on second screens
- Bugfix for using the SideView tool for open water
- Water Balance Tool in/out labels near the x axis are now located correctly
- Graph Tool and Water Balance Tool plots: time units can be chosen as s / min / hrs.
- SideView Tool and Statistics Tool: Feedback is given to user when manhole surface level is not filled in.

*3Di Models & Simulations v3.1*

- Allow rain intensities < 1 mm/hr (#180, #347)

*3Di Customisations  v1.2*

-	Remove all user interface customisations, except red menu bar
-	Add "About 3Di modeller interface" dialog

*3Di Toolbox v1.33*

These processing algorithms add the check results as layers to your QGIS project, instead of in a separate shapefile, csv, or text file. You can access them through Processing > Toolbox > 3Di > Schematisation. In the future, these processing algorithms will replace the current checker tools available in the 'Commands' Toolbox.



February 2022 (Klondike)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released threeditoolbox 1.31 and 3Di Models & simulations 3.0.2.
"3Di Models & simulations" is the new name for what was previously called "API client".
Please note: If you continue to use the old route, you still need the previous version of the plugin as well.

We have also released a new version of the Modeller Interface:
Download here the latest version: `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.22.7-1-3-Setup-x86_64.exe>`__



August 2021
^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released a new version of the Modeller Interface with the following:

- Update on the animation toolbar
- Added tooling for dry weather flow calculations
- Water depth maps for multiple timesteps
- Bugfix Sideview Tool

Download here the latest version: `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.16.7-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`__


*Important note for QGIS Users*

Please note that installing QGIS has been undergoing some changes, at the moment the OSGeo4W Network Installer is the recommended way to install QGIS. See https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html for more information. This change does not apply for users that use the Modeller Interface installer.


*Animation Toolbar update*

The styling of all animation layers has been improved. The value categories are no longer fixed but based on the value distribution in the entire simulation. In the 2D domain, the animation toolbar now visualizes cells instead of nodes. Furthermore, the option 'relative to timestep 0' was introduced. This allows you to switch between e.g. absolute water levels and water level relative to the start of your simulation.

Below are examples of a dike breach. Animation 1 is showing relative change in water level and discharge. The plot is done for every calculation cell and flow line. Animation 2 is the same situation as an absolute plot showing the water level per calculation cell and the discharge over the flow lines.
Some other improvements to the toolbar include:

-	More user feedback.
-	The animation layers are removed when the Animation Toolbar is deactivated.
-	The groundwater layers are only displayed when the simulation includes groundwater.

*Dry weather flow calculator*

In some cases it is required to add dry weather flow to a simulation. To enable this a processing tool has been added to convert dry weather flow as defined in the model spatialite (dry weather flow attribute of the impervious surface layer) to lateral discharge timeseries that can be used as in your simulations.
In our earlier API (v1), dry weather flow was read automatically from the spatialite and calculated according a standard distribution.
In the current API (v3), dry weather flow is added as lateral discharges to allow for more flexibility. E.g. in the distribution of dry weather flow over the day.

*Water depth maps for multiple timestep*

We have added the option to generate water depth/level maps for a range of timesteps. The output is a multiband geotiff, where each band contains the water depth map of one timestep.

The water depth processing algorithm also has various minor bugfixes and improvements:

-	Selecting DEM layer from project no longer gives an error.
-	Generating outputs for timestep 0 without moving the timestep slider no longer gives an error.
-	Improved readability of LCD display by adding days to the display.
-	Set LCD value to 00:00 when file is loaded.
-	More accurate description of what the tool does.


*Bugfix SideView tool*

The SideView tool no longer worked since QGIS 3.16.6. This has now been fixed


May 21st 2021 - 3Di API QGIS Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released a new version of the `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.16.7-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`__ and an update of our 3Di API QGIS Client to version 2.4.1. The following has been fixed:

- Users no longer get a throttling warning when trying to start a simulation.
- Results download only shows results for the model that is selected in the panel.

The location of plugins has changed from https://plugins.lizard.net/plugins.xml to https://plugins.3di.live/plugins.xml

April 22nd 2021 - 3Di Toolbox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released a new version of the `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.16.4-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`__ and the `ThreediToolbox 1.18 <https://plugins.lizard.net/ThreeDiToolbox.1.18.zip>`_ .
This is a fix for the error *"Couldn't load plugin 'ThreeDiToolbox' due to an error when calling its classFactory() method
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'alembic' "*

April 1st 2021 - 3Di Toolbox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Due to some changes under the hood in QGIS 3.16 we have released a new version of the `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.16.4-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`_ and the `ThreediToolbox 1.17 <https://plugins.lizard.net/ThreeDiToolbox.1.17.zip>`_

March 8th 2021
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the latest version of the `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.16.4-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`_ , which at the time of writing uses QGIS 3.16.4.
For QGIS users: upgrade the plugin using the plugin panel. In case this doesn't work, it is possible to install the plugins as zip file. The latest versions are `ThreediToolbox 1.16 <https://plugins.lizard.net/ThreeDiToolbox.1.16.1.zip>`_  and Threedi-API-QGIS client is 2.4.0.


*Local calculation of water depth & water level maps*

It is possible to generate water depth maps for every time step with the newest version of the Modeller Interface. To generate these water depth maps, 3Di applies a special algorithm that combines the water level results with the information of the DEM. This algorithm creates visually appealing maps. The maps show the water level and water depth results on high resolution, these can be based on the interpolated and on the non-interpolated water level results.

A quick guide to generate water depth maps:

Processing ^^> Toolbox ^^> 3Di ^^> post-processed results ^^> water depth

Or check out our documentation: :ref:`3di_processing_toolbox`


*Extended support for starting simulations using the Modeller Interface*

We have added the following support for starting simulations from the Modeller Interface:

- added support for wind. See our user manual: :ref:`simulate_api_qgis` or our technical documentation : :ref:`wind_effects`  for more information.
- added option of tags. This can be used to tag a simulation with a project related tag. This way it is easier to organise simulations.
- added time-interpolation options for laterals
- added the option for Netcdf upload for rain
- option to set base URL for the API (for use of 3Di in other countries)

The following bugs have been fixed:

- start time is now correctly used
- search window for models is now case insensitive
- bug fix lateral file upload

*Bugfix in the ThreeDiToolbox*

- Fix import sufhyd coordinates swapped on newer gdal versions.


February 22nd 2021
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- We now support QGIS 3.16 for our toolbox.

Please not that the Modeller Interface is not yet upgraded to QGIS 3.16, we will do so when the QGIS repo's are updated.

For QGIS users: upgrade the plugin using the plugin panel.


*3Di Modeller Interface styling improvements*

Based on your feedback we have improved the styling of the schematizations in the Modeller Interface. Not only that, we now have support for multiple stylings! Check out the video to see how it works.

The improvements are:

- For weirs, orifices and culverts, the styling now indicates when flow in one or both directions is impossible (discharge coefficient - 0)
- Grid refinement styling now indicates the refinement level
- Multiple stylings are added next to the default. Switching to these stylings allows you to visualize flow direction, code, id, storage area, bank level, reference level, invert level, crest level, diameters and dimensions, min/max of timeseries, and pump capacity.Â How it works is explained in the docs: :ref:`multiplestyles`

*Schematization checker improvements*

We are constantly working on improving the 3Di experience. Based on user experience analysis we have added the following checks to the schematization checker:

- Add check ConnectionNodesDistance which ensure all connection_nodes have a minimum distance between each other.
- Set the geometry of the following tables as required: impervious_surface, obstacle, cross_section_location, connection_nodes, grid_refinement, surface, 2d_boundary_conditions and 2d_lateral.
- Add check for open cross-section when NumericalSettings. use_of_nested_newton is turned off.
- Add checks to ensure some of the fields in numerical settings are larger than 0.
- Add check to ensure an isolated pipe always has a storage area.
- Add check to see if a connection_node is connected to an artifact (pipe/channel/culvert/weir/pumpstation/orifice).

*Bugfixes in 3Di Modeller Interface*

- Fixed h5py error, it is now possible to use the 3Di toolbox on QGIS 3.10.12
- Fixed x-axis bug in the water balance tool


.. _release_notes_api:

  on a period of 1 year before or after the *start_date* based if the current date (month & day) are before or after start_date (month & day).

April 25th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for uploading additional initial water levels to an existing 3Di models. Both 1D and 2D are supported.

February 2022 (Klondike)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**General**

- Reordering of nodes and lines: the order and ids of the calculation nodes and flowlines will be different.

- Reprojection of 1D objects: the EPSG database that is used when reprojecting spatialite geometries to the model projection was upgraded from version 7.9 to 10.041. Due to improvements in the projection definitions, this may result in effects due to geometries that are displaced relative to the DEM (and correspondingly the 2D grid), for example 1D-2D lines or grid refinements. Note that in all cases no correction grids (e.g. RDNAPTRANS) or date-dependent datum shifts (e.g. ETRS89 to WGS84) are applied. Versions corresponding to EPSG database 7.9: PROJ4 4.8.0, August 2011 Versions corresponding to EPSG database 10.041: PROJ4 8.2.1, Dec 2021


**Channels, pipes and culverts**

- 1D initial waterlevels on channels/pipes/culvert nodes are now (linearly) interpolated between connection nodes.

- The volume of an embedded channel/pipe/culvert (that is added to the 2D nodes in which they are embedded) now stems precisely from the part of the channel/pipe/culvert that is inside the 2D cell. Previously, this was not the case.

- If the direction of a channel/pipe/culvert geometry is reversed compared to the âconnection_node_startâ and âconnection_node_endâ, then this is now fixed automatically.

- The calculation type of culverts is not ignored anymore.

- For calculation nodes on channels with connected calculation type, the cross section will be used until the surface level of the DEM. This will give differences for channels with connected calculation type in case the cross section is below the surface level.


**Cross section definitions**

- A new âclosed rectangleâ (type 0) cross section definition is available. This definition requires both width and height.

- For tabulated cross section definitions, the input is validated more strictly. Previously, a wrong input (e.g. using a comma as separator between numbers) resulted in the table only receiving one value.


**2D initial waterlevels**

- The no data value in 2D initial waterlevels is now excluded while taking the min, max, or mean. This means that cells with partial data now receive a water level whereas in the old route they did not.


**Obstacles / Levees**

- The algorithm with which 2D flowlines are assigned to obstacles/levees is changed. Now, every flowline that intersects the obstacle/levee is assigned to it.

- Also levee/obstacle geometries can be drawn outside the DEM area, which was previously not possible.


**2D boundary conditions**

- The constraints on 2D boundary conditions have become less strict. Every border cell can now get a boundary condition. It is required however that the border cells of a single boundary condition form one horizontal or vertical edge. The boundary condition does not need to be precisely at the cell edge anymore. Also it is not required anymore to adjust the DEM to precisely align to the border cells; if there is no DEM data at the outer cell edge, the DEM data will be extrapolated.


**Gridadmin / Results NetCDF**

- The gridadmin.h5 and results_3di.nc file now uses NaN (not-a-number) instead of -9999 for missing values in float columns. Integer type columns still have â9999 to denote âmissingâ.


January 31st 2022 (Klondike)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following endpoints have been added to the API:

- Upload Schematisations
- Download Schematisations

**Bugfixes:**

- Bugfix: added missing permissions for local rain endpoints and deleting physical/timestep/numerical settings.
- Fixed bug in threedimodels levees geojson download.
- Fixed websocket issue for raster-edit update and delete events

**1D initial waterlevels:**

- Enabled management of initial_waterlevel and initial_groundwater_level model rasters for default users.
-  Added 'dimension' field (default: 'two_d', optional new value: 'one_d') to threedimodels/{pk}/initial_waterlevels.
- Added simulations/{simulation_pk}/initial/1d_water_level/file resource to refer to initial_waterlevels with dimension = 'one_d'.
- A POST on simulations/{simulation_pk}/initial/1d_water_level/predefined now also creates a simulations/{simulation_pk}/initial/file resource. The scheduler ignores the /predefined one if the /file resource exists.

3Di Computational core
----------------------

.. _3di_calccore_release_20231807:

June 18th, 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Storage in the groundwater domain is more accurate and less cell size dependent because it uses subgrid
- Initialization time (when starting a simulation) for models with many 1D lines has been reduced
- Bugfix: Missing headers in matrix.log
- Bugfix: Embedded wet surface is now calculated *after* merging the volume table.
- Bugfix: Source geometry for raster and obstacle edit would not be set, leading to incorrect assumption of EPSG:4326

June 2023
^^^^^^^^^

- Vegetation drag
- Groundwater 1D2D exchange
- Groundwater 2D boundary conditions
- Added has_vegetation attribute to model meta data
- Bugfix: DEM edit for a model with interflow would set wrong waterlevel.
- Bugfix: 1D boundary nodes are now included in the definition of the 1D extent of the model
- Output NetCDF files now contain the attributes *simulation_id*, *schematisation_id*, *revision_id*, and *model_id*

April 2023
^^^^^^^^^^

- Channels with calculation type *connected* or *double connected* can now be placed outside the DEM, as long as they connect to a location where a 2D cell is present. If a 'potential breach' or 'exchange line' is used to set the location to which the calculation node connects, the location of those features determines whether an error is raised. If a channel with calculation type connected is outside of the DEM, but the closest point on its exchange_line is on the DEM, the computational grid can be built and the 3Di model is valid.

- 1D-2D links that cross an obstacle will take the exchange level from the obstacle

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fixed the initialisation of the calculation core.

- Let a simulation crash when a NaN occurs during the calculation.

January 31st 2022 (Klondike)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This release contains a big change in 3Di model creation. The Grid and Table builder have been rewritten from the ground up.

**Breaking changes**

- Previously, 3Di models were created from repositories in models.lizard.net, by inpy. The new 3Di models are created from schematisations in the 3Di API, by POSTing to the "create_threedimodel" API endpoint. Because of a new Grid generation. Node ids can differ from old versions of a threedimodel.

**General**

- CRS transformation (reprojection): transformations from the native spatialite projection (WGS84) to the model projection is now done using the PROJ4 library version 8.2.0 instead of version 4.8. Expect slight changes in coordinates if you use CRS definitions that received updates in the past years (Dutch ârijksdriehoekâ, British national grid).
- Quadtree creation (2D Cells)
- The behavior around refinements is altered slightly. Grid cell sizes at edges can differ slightly.

**Channels, pipes and culverts**

- The order of the coordinates in a channel or culvert linestring does not matter anymore. Previously, in case that the geometry was reversed (the first coordinate in the linestring coincides with the âconnection_node_endâ and vice versa), makegrid connected the âconnection_node_endâ to the wrong side of the channel.
- 1D initial waterlevels on channels/pipes/culvert nodes are now (linearly) interpolated between connection nodes.
- The volume of an embedded channel/pipe/culvert (that is added to the 2D nodes in which they are embedded) now stems precisely from the part of the channel/pipe/culvert that is inside the 2D cell. Previously, this was not the case.

**Cross section definitions**

- A new âclosed rectangleâ (type 0) cross section definition is available. This definition requires both width and height.
- For tabulated cross section definitions, the input is validated more strictly. Previously, a wrong input (e.g. using a comma as separator between numbers) resulted in the table only receiving one value.

**Obstacles / Levees**

- The algorithm with which 2D flowlines are assigned to obstacles/levees is changed. Now, every flowline that intersects the obstacle/levee is assigned to it.
- Also levee/obstacle geometries can be drawn outside the DEM area, which was previously not possible.

**2D boundary conditions**

- The constraints on 2D boundary conditions have become less strict. It is required that the 2D boundary condition intersects a horizontal or vertical string of cells. If there is no DEM data at the outer cell edge, the DEM data will be extrapolated to compute the cross sectional area of the boundary flow line.

**Gridadmin**

- The gridadmin file now uses NaN (not-a-number) instead of -9999 for missing values in float columns. Integer type columns still have â9999 to denote âmissingâ.
- The following datasets were added for nodes: code, dmax, s1d, embedded_in, boundary_type, has_dem_averaged
- A group "nodes_embeddedâ was added.
- The following datasets were added for lines: s1d, ds1d, dpumax, flod, flou, cross1, cross2, cross_weight
- The following values were removed from meta: ijmax, imax, jap1d, jmax, levnms, lgrmin, linall, lintot, n2dall, nodall, nodobc, nodtot.
- The âpreparedâ attributes were removed.
- The following datasets were removed from pumps: nodp1d, p1dtyp. The datasets code and upper_stop_level were added.
- A group âcross_sectionsâ was added.
- The following datasets were removed from breaches: llev, kcu, seq_ids.
- The group âsurfaceâ was added if the model contains 0D (surfaces/impervious surfaces)


October 18th 2021
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released a new version of the computational core.

- There is an improved version to compute flow through a breach. The new formula is 2D-grid-size independent and allows sensitivity studies to be conducted based on the discharge. In most cases, your discharge results will remain roughly the same. Also, the discharge becomes tunable, to offer an easy sensitivity option. It also allows you to get back your previous results.

Bugfixes:

- Fixed the computation of the breach width. Especially, the initial growth was underestimated in case the time to reach the maximum breach depth was large.
- Fixed a small bug in the raster edits. This fixed also the option to perform raster edits in computational cells having only 4 subgrid cells.
- Fix for broad weir formulation for the critical conditions

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In short the following fixes are included in the calculation core:
- Fix for long crested weir; new routine that does not request an extra computational node.
- Fix for short crested weir; Fix to determine super- from sub-critical regime.
- Fix for weirs for negative subcritical flows
- Fix for 1D coordinates in netcdf file: The z-coordinates of the boundary points, are now set correctly in the netcdf
- Fix for initial conditions in netcdf file: In case of 1D-2D models, some variables, like the wet-surface areas of a computational node, the wrong value was written in the results netcdf at the start of the simulation.

Long crested weirs: The formulation of the long crested weir has been replaced by a new one. This new version is based on the law of Bernoulli instead of an alternative implementation of the advective terms for a regular 1D element. The flow over the weir is an accurate computation of the flow under ideal circumstances, but the new formulation does not require an extra computational node and has proven to be more stable under varying flow conditions.

Short crested weirs: Flow over a weir knows three different stages: sub-, supercritical and critical flow.  Under super-critical flow conditions, the formulation remains the same. We fixed the formulation under sub-critical flow conditions and in strong varying flow conditions.  The biggest change in discharge behaviour is expected for weirs that flow in negative direction. Moreover, the time dependency of the flow over the weir has been adjusted. This has no effect on stationary flow, but has a slightly improved stabilizing effect on the flow under changing flow conditions.
