Breach flow
------------

In a 3Di model, flow may occur between 1D and 2D elements. In certain cases this exchange is limited by a levee. The exchange height is determined by the height of the levee. When a few extra properties of the levee are specified for these connections, a breach can be modelled that can grow over time. More information on levees, can be found in :ref:`obstacles`


Exchange formulation

The flow through a breach is calculated with the broad crested weir equation. This equation takes into account the length and the friction over the weir.
