Priority incidents
-------------------

The responsiveness of Nelen & Schuurmans is driven by the severity of an incident.
All incidents within the agreement can be subdivided into priorities.
There are three levels here.
Each level is based on an urgency.
The initiative for determining urgency lies primarily with the applicant.
The levels are:

* **Prio 1 (high):** 3Di functionality is completely unavailable or inaccessible. The situation requires immediate attention. The work and/or management processes are hindered or the importance to the Client is large with no workaround possible.
* **Prio 2 (medium):** The work and/or control processes are hindered or the Client's importance is large, but a workaround is possible.
* **Prio 3 (low):** Not urgent. 3Di is impaired, a single function is impacted but key business processes are not interrupted. The problem causes minimal operational or business impact, a general technical question or enhancement request.


Model specific questions
-----------------------------

Beyond the scope are questions about model schematisations or questions about the validity of 3Di results,
for which the customer can purchase an additional service.
For more info the customer can contact the local 3Di consultant or email to info@nelen-schuurmans.nl.
