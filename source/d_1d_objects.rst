Notes for modellers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General notes
"""""""""""""
- 1D boundary conditions can only be applied to connection nodes that have a single connection to the rest of the network.
- The pipe, channel, or structure directly connected to the boundary condition must have calculation type isolated.
- 1D boundary conditions cannot be placed on the same connection node as a pump station.
- 1D laterals placed on a connection node with a 1D boundary condition will be ignored.
- Surfaces and impervious surfaces mapped to a connection node with a 1D boundary condition will be ignored.

Time series
"""""""""""
Format the time series as Comma Separated Values (CSV), with the time (in minutes since the start of the simulation) in the first column and the value (units dependent on the boundary type) in the second column. For example::

    0,145.20
    15,145.23
    30,145.35
    45,145.38
    60,145.15

- The time series string cannot contain any spaces or empty rows
- The boundary condition time series is stored in the simulation template and is not part of the 3Di model itself. It can be overridden when starting a new simulation, without the need to create a new revision of the schematisation.
- The time unit in the 1D boundary condition table *in the schematisation* is minutes, while the 3Di API expects this input in seconds. A conversion is applied when the reading the data from the schematisation. If you upload a CSV file with 1D boundary condition time series via the simulation wizard, you can choose the time unit (see :ref:`simulate_api_qgis_boundary_conditions`)
- For boundary types velocity (2), discharge (3) and Sommerfeld (5), the drawing direction of the channel, pipe, or structure determines sign of the input value. For velocity and discharge, this means that if the 1D boundary condition is placed on the end connection node, positive values result in boundary *outflow*. For the Sommerfeld boundary, a positive gradient for a 1D boundary condition that is placed at the end connection node means that the waterlevel downstream is higher than upstream, i.e. this will result in boundary *inflow*.
- The time series must cover the entire simulation period.
- All 1D boundary conditions must have the same time steps
- The time series values are interpolated between the defined times
- In case of multiple boundaries in 1 model: make sure they all have the same number of timeseries rows with the same temporal interval.
- When editing the time series field in using SQL (sqlite dialect), use ``char(10)`` as line separator. The example time series shown above would look like this::

    "0,145.20"||char(10)||"15,145.23"||char(10)||"30,145.35"||char(10)||"45,145.38"||char(10)||"60,145.15"

Channel
-------

A natural or artificial open channel. Channels can have a variable bed level, bed friction and cross section along their length. This information is stored in another object, the :ref:`cross_section_location`. A channel can have one or more cross-section locations, depending on the variability of the channel.

See :ref:`channelflow` for more details.

When using the 3Di Schematisation Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The *Connection nodes* and a *Cross-section location* are added automatically. 
- Do not forget to fill in the required feature attributes for the *Cross-section location*.

Notes for modellers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo::
   Refer to "how to schematise open water systems" when that section is finished

- Use 1D channels wisely. In many applications, schematising waterways in 2D is preferable. See :ref:`channelflow` and :ref:`calculation_types`.
- All channels must have at least one :ref:`cross_section_location`.

Calculation type 'embedded'
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Embedded channels add extra connections between 2D grid cells, but ignore obstacles and levees.
- Make sure the embedded channel profile always lays partially below the DEM; embedded channels cannot 'float' above the DEM.
- Embedded channels only function when they connect several 2D grid cells, so make sure no embedded channel falls completely inside one 2D grid cell
- Do not place boundary conditions directly on embedded channels.

Calculation types 'connected' and 'double connected'
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For channels with calculation type 'connected' and 'double connected', 1D2D connections connect each 1D calculation point to the 2D cell it is in. Therefore, channels with these calculation types need to be in a 2D cell. Alternatively, you may use an :ref:`exchange_line` to customise the 1D2D connections. When using an exchange line, the channel does not need to be in 2D cells, but the exchange line needs to be in 2D cells.

Notes for modellers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connection nodes and calculation nodes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Connection nodes are not the same as calculation nodes. When 3Di generates the computational grid from the schematisation, a calculation node is created for each connection nodes, but additional 1D calculation nodes may also be created in between. See the :ref:`grid` section for further details.


Initial water level
"""""""""""""""""""

- For calculation nodes that are added along the length of a channel, pipe, or culvert, initial water levels are linearly interpolated between connection nodes. See the :ref:`grid` section for further details.

- The intial water level is stored in the simulation template and is not part of the 3Di model itself. It can be overridden when starting a new simulation, without the need to create a new revision of the schematisation.

Storage area
""""""""""""
- Storage area on connection nodes is additional to the storage that is defined by the dimensions of channels, culverts and pipes. See :ref:`techref_storage_in_1d_domain` for more details.

- To calculate storage volume from the storage area, the height of the water column (water level minus bottom level) needs to be known. If a manhole is defined at the connection node, the manhole's bottom level is used. Otherwise, the lowest bottom (reference level or invert level) of the channels, culverts or pipes that connect to the connection node is used.

- For connection nodes that are not connected to channels, a storage area larger than zero is recommended.

- If a manhole is defined on the connection node, the storage area must be larger than zero. Note that the manhole dimensions (shape, width, and length) are for administrative purposes only and are not used to calculate the storage during the simulation.

- Connection nodes with large storage (i.e. the square root of the storage area is much larger than the width of the incoming channel) reduce the flow velocity and advective force.

.. _cross_section_location_notes_for_modellers:

Notes for modellers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- A cross-section location should be placed on top of a channel vertex that is not the start or end vertex
- If the channel calculation point distance is smaller than the distance between cross section locations, values in the cross section locations along the channel are interpolated, see :ref:`techref_calculation_point_distance`.
- If there are multiple cross-section locations between two **calculation nodes** (not connection nodes), only the first cross-section location is used.

Reference level
"""""""""""""""
This is the bed level of the channel and the reference level for the cross-section. For example, if the reference level is 12.0 m MSL and the cross-section a tabulated rectangle with a width of 5 m at height 0, this means that the channel is 5 m wide at 12.0 m MSL.

.. _culvert:

Culvert
-------

Culverts are used to schematise pipes in open water systems.

In contrast to an :ref:`orifice`, the flow behaviour in a culvert is assumed to be determined by shape and much less dominated by entrance losses. Culverts can be used for longer sections of pipe-like structures and do not have to be straight. Shorter, straight culverts are best schematised as an :ref:`orifice`.

- The *connection nodes* are added automatically


Notes for modellers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cross-section describes the inside of the culvert. If you only know the outer dimensions, you have to discount the wall thickness.

.. _culvert_discharge_coefficients:

Discharge coefficients
""""""""""""""""""""""
The discharge is multiplied by this value. The energy loss caused by the change in flow velocity at the entrance and exit are accounted for by 3Di. The discharge coefficients can be used to account for any additional energy loss. 'Positive' applies to flow in the drawing direction of the structure (from start node to end node); 'negative' applies to flow in the opposite direction.



.. _manhole:

Manhole
-------

Manholes are used to explicitly define the calculation type, bottom level, and/or 1D2D exchange level at the location of a connection node. In sewer models, they are commonly used to schematise inspection manholes, pumping station reservoirs and outlets. Manholes can also be used in open water systems, when you want to to explicitly set the calculation type, bottom level or 1D2D exchange level at a specific location.

Notes for modellers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Connection nodes for which a manhole is defined, must have a storage area larger than zero.
- Only one manhole can be defined for each connection node.

Drain level
"""""""""""
- Water can flow from the 1D domain to the 2D domain if the 1D water level exceeds the drain level (and vice versa).
- In 1D-2D models, this setting only applies to manholes with calculation type 'connected'
- In 1D-only models, the drain level is used as the street level, above which the storage area widens to the "manhole storage area" value specified in the global settings.
- If the drain level is not filled in, 3Di will use the DEM value at the location of the manhole, or, in case of 1D-only models, the highest top of the pipes starting or ending at this manhole.
- In 1D-2D models, the 1D-2D exchange level is the maximum of the manhole drain level and the 2D cell's bottom level. See the figures below for an illustration of this.

.. _orifice:

Orifice
-------

An orifice can be used to schematise hydraulic structures like gates, bridges, or culverts. It can be used in open water systems as well as in sewerage systems.

An orifice is commonly used to schematise structures that are closed at the top of the cross-section, whereas the :ref:`weir` is commonly used for structures that are open at the top. However, both types of cross-sections can be used for either structure, and 3Di uses them in the calculation in the same way. See :ref:`weirs_and_orifices` for further details.

Notes for modellers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the computational grid, an orifice will always be represented by a single flowline. Therefore, orifices do not have a calculation point distance and calculation type. The calculation type of the start and end nodes is determined by the channels, culverts, manholes, and pipes connected to them.

Crest level
"""""""""""
This is the reference level for the cross-section. For example, if the crest level is 12.0 m and the cross-section a circle with a diameter of 0.5 m, the opening will start at 12.0 m and end at 12.5 m

.. _orifice_discharge_coefficients:

The discharge coefficients can be used to account for any additional energy loss.

- The *connection nodes* and *manholes* will be added automatically.
- To draw a single pipe, the geometry must have exactly 2 vertices. A line with more than 2 vertices will be split into several pipes.
- To digitize a trajectory of multiple pipes, first digitize the manholes, fill in the bottom levels, and then draw the pipe trajectory over these manholes by adding a vertex at each of the manholes. The pipes that are generated will use the manhole's bottom levels as invert levels and the *connection nodes* and *manholes* will be added automatically.


.. _pipe_notes_for_modeller:

Notes for modellers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cross-section describes the inside of the pipe. If you only know the outer dimensions, you have to discount the wall thickness.

Adding a pipe trajectory
""""""""""""""""""""""""
When you digitize (draw) a pipe feature with more than two vertices, each vertex will be converted into a connection node plus manhole, connected by pipes. If you digitize a pipe that connects existing manholes, the pipe(s) will use the manholes' bottom levels as their invert levels and automatically refer to the correct the connection nodes. Therefore, the quickest way to  digitize a trajectory of multiple pipes is to first digitize the manholes, fill in the bottom levels, and then draw the pipe trajectory over these manholes by adding a vertex at each of the manholes.

Material
""""""""
The material is not used in the calculation, but can be used to estimate the friction value. The processing algorithm "Guess Indicators" recognizes the following values:  0: concrete; 1: pvc; 2: gres; 3: cast iron; 4: brickwork; 5: HPE; 6: HDPE; 7: plate iron; 8: steel.

- Combined sewer (0)

- Sanitary sewer (2)
- Transport (3)
- Spillway (4)
- Syphon (5)
- Storage (6)
- Storage and settlement tank (7)
