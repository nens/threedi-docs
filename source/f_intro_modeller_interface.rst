Modeller Interface 
======================

Introduction
--------------
The Modeller Interface (MI) will help you with building 3Di models and analysing results locally. The MI will also assist you in interacting with the 3Di-API and downloading the results from the 3Di calculation servers. The MI is part of QGIS with various pre-installed plugins: the 3Di Toolbox to analyse results, the 3Di API Client to start calculations, download results and some third party plugins. The interface has been cleaned compared to a standard QGIS installation, it shows only relevant buttons for model building and analysing. 

For instructions how to download the Modeller Interface or the plugins see :ref:`plugin_installation`

Overview of the 3Di API client
-----------------------------------------

After installation of the plugin, a panel is available. If you don't see this panel, check the installation instructions.
