Building and editing a model schematisation
==============================================

3Di can be used for many different purposes like simulating big floods or urban runoff processes. For each purpose the modeller should decide which components to use and how to set them up to create a working model. 
The sections below help you with these tasks by listing several requirements, options and applications per component.
