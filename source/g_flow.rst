Flow
-----------

In 3Di four different flow domains are defined. These domains are defined as :ref:`surface_flow`, :ref:`interflow`, :ref:`groundwater` and :ref:`onedee_flow`. The flow in these domains are computed based on conservation of mass and momentum. There are differences in the computation of the flow per domain. These are explained in the sections below.
