- :doc:`i_time_series_plotter` to plot the results at flowlines or nodes in a graph.
- :doc:`i_sideview_tool` to analyze the water levels through the simulation in your 1D domain.
- :doc:`i_results_aggregation` to quickly aggregate the results over the entire simulation, using preset outputs and styling.
- :doc:`i_water_balance_tool` to determine the water balance for a given area that takes all flows in and out of the area into account.
- :doc:`i_watershed_tool` to determine the inflow and outflow catchments for any given location.
- :doc:`i_processing_toolbox` provides several post-processing options of the results.
