Analysing results in the 3Di Modeller Interface
===============================================

The 3Di Modeller Interface offers a range of tools to visualise and analyse computational grids and simulation results. These tools are available from the *3Di Results Analysis toolbar* and from the 3Di section in the *Processing Toolbox*.

These tools relate the time series of the flow variables (water levels, volumes, velocities, discharges, etc.) that are stored in the :ref:`output files<outputs>` to the nodes and flowlines in the :ref:`computational_grid`.
