Analysing results in the 3Di Modeller Interface
===============================================

The 3Di Modeller Interface offers a range of tools to visualise and analyse computational grids and simulation results. These tools are available from the *3Di Results Analysis toolbar* and from the 3Di section in the *Processing Toolbox*.

These tools relate the time series of the flow variables (water levels, volumes, velocities, discharges, etc.) that are stored in the :ref:`output files<outputs>` to the nodes and flowlines in the :ref:`computational_grid`.

From 3Di Toolbox to 3Di Results Analysis
----------------------------------------

Users familiar with the 3Di Toolbox, but new to its successor 3Di Results Analysis are advised to read the :ref:`transition_from_3di_toolbox`.

The 3Di Toolbox will replaced by the :ref:`3Di Results Analysis plugin<mi_3di_plugins>` on October 1st, 2023.
