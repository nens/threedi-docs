3Di API
-------

March 3, 2024
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add water quality settings and substance settings.

- Add substances to leakage and surface sources and sinks endpoints.

- Improve time series validation for substances concentrations, leakage, and surface sources & sinks.

- Stream ucx / ucy over web socket (#2120)

- Change bulk lateral creation to reduce memory usage (#2129)

February 2, 2024
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Include substance names in water quality result file(s)
- Bugfix: issue with "Could not find aggregation file for initial groundwaterlevel raster" resolved.
- Bugfix: DEM edits in models with for groundwater

September 21, 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Extend FrictionType enum with ChÃ©zy friction with conveyance and Manning friction with conveyance.

.. _3di_api_release_20231807:

June 18th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Invite email for organisation for users now shows which organisation they are invited to
- An e-mail is sent when your simulation has crashed
- Allow Lizard postprocessing after simulation has finished. (when not already requested)
- Simulation templates persist when regenerating 3Di Model
- Simulation templates are inherited from 3Di Model of the previous revision
- If simulation results become > 10 GB, simulation crashes with clear error message, instead of taking down the calculation node (and any other simulations that depend on that node)
- Added dequeue action putting a queued` simulation back in created state.
- Bugfix: Set max timestep to default timestep when max timestep is undefined
- Improved speed of /simulations/ endpoint by introducing is_template field.


June 14th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added *first_name* and *last_name* to SimulationStatus API listing resources.

- Added support for setting a *start_date* on a contract. If set, the contract *hours_used* are calculated either based
  on a period of 1 year before or after the *start_date* based if the current date (month & day) are before or after start_date (month & day).

April 25th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for uploading additional initial water levels to an existing 3Di models. Both 1D and 2D are supported.

- Added support for uploading and downloading computational grid Geopackage files for 3Di models.

- Bugfix: We have made the use of Lizard raster rain in a simulation more robust by using longer retries getting data from Lizard.

- The duration of a constant wind event can now be patched while the simulation is paused.

- In the near future an extra log file (scheduler.log) will be added to log files in the downloadable ZIP file. The scheduler log file is intended for 3Di developers to identify problems when simulations have crashed.

February 6th 2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for uploading and downloading (exported gridadmin.h5) Geopackage files on threedimodels.
- Added copy-to-threedimodel endpoint.

Corresponding version updates: sqlite schema version 214, threedi-modelchecker 0.35, threedigrid-builder 1.7, threedigrid 2.0.
- The threedimodels/<id>/potentialbreaches endpoint is only filled with breaches having a content_pk, levee material and maximum breach depth (in gridadmin).
- Removed the (admin-only) threedimodels/<id>/bulk_potentialbreaches endpoint.

- Removed the "potential_breach" field on the breach event.
- Fixed model checker (v0.33), included raster checks via rasterio.
- Invalidate boundary files without any boundaries.
- Upgrade threedi-tables to 3.0, raster reading is now done through a VRT, so that any projection / sampling is allowed.
- Upgraded threedi-modelchecker to 0.34 and threedigrid-builder to 1.6, allowing TABULATED_YZ profiles, and adding rudimentary support for exchange lines and new potential breach input.
- Disable inpy model mounts

February 2022 (Klondike)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**General**

- Reordering of nodes and lines: the order and ids of the calculation nodes and flowlines will be different.

- Reprojection of 1D objects: the EPSG database that is used when reprojecting spatialite geometries to the model projection was upgraded from version 7.9 to 10.041. Due to improvements in the projection definitions, this may result in effects due to geometries that are displaced relative to the DEM (and correspondingly the 2D grid), for example 1D-2D lines or grid refinements. Note that in all cases no correction grids (e.g. RDNAPTRANS) or date-dependent datum shifts (e.g. ETRS89 to WGS84) are applied. Versions corresponding to EPSG database 7.9: PROJ4 4.8.0, August 2011 Versions corresponding to EPSG database 10.041: PROJ4 8.2.1, Dec 2021


**Channels, pipes and culverts**

- 1D initial waterlevels on channels/pipes/culvert nodes are now (linearly) interpolated between connection nodes.

- The volume of an embedded channel/pipe/culvert (that is added to the 2D nodes in which they are embedded) now stems precisely from the part of the channel/pipe/culvert that is inside the 2D cell. Previously, this was not the case.

- If the direction of a channel/pipe/culvert geometry is reversed compared to the âconnection_node_startâ and âconnection_node_endâ, then this is now fixed automatically.

- The calculation type of culverts is not ignored anymore.

- For calculation nodes on channels with connected calculation type, the cross section will be used until the surface level of the DEM. This will give differences for channels with connected calculation type in case the cross section is below the surface level.


**Cross section definitions**

- A new âclosed rectangleâ (type 0) cross section definition is available. This definition requires both width and height.

- For tabulated cross section definitions, the input is validated more strictly. Previously, a wrong input (e.g. using a comma as separator between numbers) resulted in the table only receiving one value.


**2D initial waterlevels**

- The no data value in 2D initial waterlevels is now excluded while taking the min, max, or mean. This means that cells with partial data now receive a water level whereas in the old route they did not.


**Obstacles / Levees**

- The algorithm with which 2D flowlines are assigned to obstacles/levees is changed. Now, every flowline that intersects the obstacle/levee is assigned to it.

- Also levee/obstacle geometries can be drawn outside the DEM area, which was previously not possible.


**2D boundary conditions**

- The constraints on 2D boundary conditions have become less strict. Every border cell can now get a boundary condition. It is required however that the border cells of a single boundary condition form one horizontal or vertical edge. The boundary condition does not need to be precisely at the cell edge anymore. Also it is not required anymore to adjust the DEM to precisely align to the border cells; if there is no DEM data at the outer cell edge, the DEM data will be extrapolated.


**Gridadmin / Results NetCDF**

- The gridadmin.h5 and results_3di.nc file now uses NaN (not-a-number) instead of -9999 for missing values in float columns. Integer type columns still have â9999 to denote âmissingâ.


January 31st 2022 (Klondike)

**Bugfixes:**

- Bugfix: added missing permissions for local rain endpoints and deleting physical/timestep/numerical settings.
- Fixed bug in threedimodels levees geojson download.
- Fixed websocket issue for raster-edit update and delete events

**1D initial waterlevels:**

- Enabled management of initial_waterlevel and initial_groundwater_level model rasters for default users.
-  Added 'dimension' field (default: 'two_d', optional new value: 'one_d') to threedimodels/{pk}/initial_waterlevels.
- Added simulations/{simulation_pk}/initial/1d_water_level/file resource to refer to initial_waterlevels with dimension = 'one_d'.
- A POST on simulations/{simulation_pk}/initial/1d_water_level/predefined now also creates a simulations/{simulation_pk}/initial/file resource. The scheduler ignores the /predefined one if the /file resource exists.
