3Di is state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulation software for pluvial, fluvial and coastal floods and flows. 3Di is applied in both urban and rural areas around the world. Unique about 3Di is the combination of fast simulations, interactive modelling, detail of the schematisation and the advanced capabilities to model hydrodynamic processes.

This documentation covers a wide range of topics and is updated regularly. It starts with a description of the full extent of the 3Di simulation software. It continues with some modelling guidelines for a range of applications. The tutorials will give you some examples on how to use, modify and/or create your 3Di models. The methods used to compute the 3Di results are described in the sections named Physics and Model Concepts.
The tutorials show you how to create and modify different types of models. The first tutorial gives you an introduction to 3Di and will assist you in taking you first steps with you 3Di Model. We have tried to explain the steps and reasons behind them quite extensively. The later tutorials assume you have sufficient knowledge about 3Di and modelling in general. They are less extensive and can be used as cheat sheets for performing different tasks. However, all tutorials assume you have some knowledge of 3Di.  Moreover, there are some programmes you will need, such as QGIS, the 3Di QGIS plugin, Google Chrome and TortoiseHG. They also assume that your organization has uploaded one or more 3Di models for use in the 3Di portal. For a complete overview of the software required, check the software section below.


.. _software:

Software
--------

To use 3Di you need these software packages:

* Recent version of Google Chrome (`Get Chrome <https://www.google.nl/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html>`_)

* The `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.lizard.net/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.4.13-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`_ or install QGIS with the appropriate plugins. For more details on how to do this see :ref:`plugin_installation`

* Recent version of TortoiseHG (`Get TortoiseHG <https://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/download/index.html>`_)

    After installation of TortoiseHG the program can be started by selecting the TortoiseHg Workbench program from the Windows Start menu. In a first use, activate the 'large files extension' by selecting from the File menu 'Settings' and then' Extensions' and select 'large filesâ€™. Also fill in your name. Press OK and restart TortoiseHG.

    Tortoise also has a built-in encrypted password manager, allowing you to push and pull revisions without being prompted for your username and    password each time. To enable the password manager:

    * Open TortoiseHg Workbench
    * Go to File > Settings > Extensions
    * Check the box 'mercurial_keyring'.
    * Restart TortoiseHg Workbench
    * Now you still have to enable the password manager for each repository you clone, see :ref:`download-repository`



Web Portals
-----------

* checkout https://3diwatermanagement.com/3di-start/ for a up-to-date overview of all available 3Di portals

* <your-organisation>.lizard.net to view and download saved simulations



.. _database-overview:

Database overview
-----------------

The database overview shows the complete overview of tables that 3Di uses in the spatialite database. You can download the complete overview of tables that 3Di uses in the spatialite database :download:`here <pdf/database-overview.pdf>`. Also, this :download:`flowchart <image/flowchart_edit_model.png>` may help you while editing your model. The following links show you the database schema's for :download:`sewerage <pdf/database-schema-sewerage.pdf>` and :download:`surface water <pdf/database-schema-surface-water.pdf>`.

.. _empty_database:

Empty database
--------------

If you like to set up a new model it may be helpful to start from an empty database. Download an empty spatialite database :download:`here <other/empty.sqlite>`.

Please be aware not to add any columns to existing tables in the spatialite as they may interfere with future migrations.
