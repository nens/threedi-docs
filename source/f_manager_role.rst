Tasks of a Manager
==================

As the person(s) with the *Manager* role, you manage your organisation's 3Di account and its users. You grant or revoke rights for your organisation. A manager has two main tasks:

1. :ref:`maintaining_rights`
2. :ref:`granting_rights`

You can do this in the :ref:`Users<3di_management_users>` section of 3Di Management (`management.3di.live <management.3di.live>`_).

.. _maintaining_rights:

Maintaining rights of existing users
------------------------------------

The rights of users under your organisation do not expire automatically.
So, it is important that you regularly check whether users still need their rights.
This can include employees leaving the organisation or projects coming to an end.
Sometimes, not all rights need to be revoked; it is also possible to revoke only specific rights.
It is up to you to determine how often you want to perform this check.

.. _granting_rights:

Granting rights to new users
----------------------------

If a user needs rights for your organisation, you are responsible for granting them.
For the smooth progress of a project, it is useful to handle such requests promptly.
Granting rights does not have to be a lengthy task; rights can be granted in a minute.
For instructions, see :ref:`inviting_new_users` and :ref:`adjusting_existing_rights`.

.. tip:: Use a bookmark to go directly to 3Di Management. This way, you can give a user rights in no time.

.. tip:: Ensure that rights are discussed and granted at the beginning of a project.
    This prevents delays later due to someone waiting for their rights.

.. tip:: Don't forget to remove users' rights after a project is completed.
    This way, you actively maintain the user database and keep your data under control.

.. tip:: If you want to deactivate accounts, contact the `servicedesk <mailto:servicedesk@nelen-schuurmans.nl>`_ for assistance.
