  abstract  = {The presence of vegetation modifies flow and sediment transport in alluvial channels and hence the morphological evolution of river systems. Plants increase the local roughness, modify flow patterns and provide additional drag, decreasing the bed-shear stress and enhancing local sediment deposition. For this, it is important to take into account the presence of vegetation in morphodynamic modelling. Models describing the effects of vegetation on water flow and sediment transport already exist, but comparative analyses and validations on extensive datasets are still lacking. In order to provide practical information for modelling purposes, we analysed the performance of a large number of models on flow resistance, vegetation drag, vertical velocity profiles and bed-shear stresses in vegetated channels. Their assessments and applicability ranges are derived by comparing their predictions with measured values from a large dataset for different types of submerged and emergent vegetation gathered from the literature. The work includes assessing the performance of the sediment transport capacity formulae of Engelund and Hansen and van Rijn in the case of vegetated beds, as well as the value of the drag coefficient to be used for different types of vegetation and hydraulic conditions. The results provide a unique comparative overview of existing models for the assessment of the effects of vegetation on morphodynamics, highlighting their performances and applicability ranges.},

The detailed information can be incorporated by using the assumption of a uniform flow direction and a uniform friction slope within a part of a coarse-grid cell. It is shown in two examples that the results of coarse-grid simulations become as good as high-resolution results, but at much lower computational cost. © 2013. American Geophysical Union.

The governing differential equations are discretized with a consistent mass conservative scheme that naturally applies to all flow regimes. The resulting mildly nonlinear system, at every time step, is efficiently solved with a converging, properly devised, nested Newton-type algorithm. It will be shown that with the proposed semi-implicit model, high accuracy can be achieved at a moderate computational cost. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {A new wetting and drying algorithm for numerical modeling free-surface flows is proposed and analyzed. A well structured, mildly nonlinear system for the discrete water surface elevation is derived from the governing differential equations by requiring a correct mass balance in wet areas as well as in the region of transition from wet to dry and from dry to wet. Existence and uniqueness of the numerical solution, along with a convergence analysis of an iterative scheme for the mildly nonlinear system, is provided. The present algorithm is devised to use high-resolution bathymetric data at subgrid level. The resulting model is quite efficient, does not require a threshold value for minimal water depth, does not produce un-physical negative water depths and generates accurate results with relatively coarse mesh and large time step size. These features are illustrated on a severe test-case with known analytical solution. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract  = {The widespread availability of high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM), has led to the development of subgrid numerical modeling techniques, based on Shallow Water Equations (SWE). Detailed DEM data is clustered as much as possible within a coarse grid cell that is preferably much larger than a raster pixel. This has considerable advantages for model efficiency, in particular for flood mapping. But overland flow on hills, key to rainfall-runoff, may have several problems with accuracy and stability. These issues arise especially during downhill flooding and with surface runoff on inclined planes. It is the focus of this paper. As robust solutions we propose: (1) a special volume correction equation with intrinsic wetting and drying but without stability constraints and, (2) a simple thin layer calculation that is accurate for runoff on coarse grids with sloping subgrids.
