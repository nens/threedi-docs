Overview of the Modeller Interface
===================================

The main GUI consist of five components:

1. **Menu Bar**: provides access to functions using standard hierarchical menus.
2. **Toolbar**: provides access to most of the functions in the menu, plus additional tools for interacting with the map. Every toolbar can be moved around according to your needs. Some of the 3Di :ref:`plugins <overview_plugins>` are already added to the toolbar.
3. **Panels**: special widgets that you can interact with to perform more complex tasks. A couple of the 3Di :ref:`plugins <overview_plugins>` are in these panels.
4. **Map View**
5. **Status Bar**: provides you with general information about the map view and processed or available actions, and offers you tools to manage the map view.
