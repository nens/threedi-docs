1D2D Objects
============

1D2D objects allow for an :ref:`exchange <1d2d_exchange>` between :ref:`1d_objects` and the :ref:`2D domain <2d_objects>`. There are two 1D2D objects in 3Di models:

* :ref:`exchange_line`
* :ref:`potential_breach`

.. _exchange_line:

Exchange line
-------------
Line that determines which 2D cells the calculation points of a :ref:`Channel` connect to. A 1D2D connection is created from each calculation point on the Channel to the cell in which the closest point on the Exchange line is located. Applies only to channels with :ref:`calculation_types` 'connected' or 'double connected'.

.. _potential_breach:

Potential breach
----------------
Line drawn from a Channel to a 2D cell, to create a potential breach location. At these locations, the 1D2D connection can be :ref:`breached<breaches>` during the simulation.
