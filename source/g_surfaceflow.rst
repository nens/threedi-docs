2D Surface Flow
================


The 2D surface flow is based on the 2D depth-averaged shallow water equations. These equations are based on the conservation of momentum. 3Di considers the various processes; inertia, advection, pressure and friction for computing the horizontal flow.

The documentation in general and this section specifically will soon be further improved.
