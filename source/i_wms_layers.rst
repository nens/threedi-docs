Load results as WMS layers
==========================

You can add the post-processed results from the :ref:`scenario_archive` to your project as WMS layers, such as maximum water depth maps. This has several advantages: you do not need to download anything, and you can easily view the water depth map for any time step, or see how the water depth map changes over time. 

This is easy to do with the Lizard plugin. The documentation for this tool is `part of the Lizard documentation<https://docs.lizard.net/d_qgisplugin.html>`_
