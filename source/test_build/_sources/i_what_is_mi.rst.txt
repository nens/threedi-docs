What is the Modeller Interface
===============================

The Modeller Interface is a customized version of QGIS with dedicated :ref:`plugins <overview_plugins>` for the use of 3Di. This interface is used to build schematisations, edit schematisations, start simulations and analyze results.

For more detailed information, visit the :ref:`mi_workflow` page. There are also multiple tutorials available on how to work with the Modeller Interface. The basics of the Modeller Interface are explained in the :ref:`Workflow <tutorial1_workflow>` Tutorial.

 
Functionality of the Modeller Interface 
-----------------------------------------

The Modeller Interface makes it easy to:

* Create new schematisations
* Download existing schematisations
* Edit schematisations
* Upload new revisions of a schematisation
* Generate a 3Di model from a schematisation
* Start a simulation
* Download results
* Analyze results



Technical setup
----------------
For instructions on how to install and set up the 3Di Modeller Interface, please refer to the :ref:`installation manual <MI_installation>`. This guide provides step-by-step procedures for installing and configuring the software, ensuring a smooth and trouble-free setup process.




Difference between 3Di Modeller Interface and QGIS
----------------------------------------------------
The Modeller Interface is a customized version of QGIS designed for building 3Di models. Its user interface is specifically tailored for this purpose, and comes with a range of pre-installed plugins to enhance the modeling experience.

We have chosen QGIS as our supporting platform because of the following reasons:

- QGIS comes with hundreds of powerful GIS processing tools;
- It enables the combination of web maps (aerial, topo, osm and may others) and model schematisations;
- It offers an extensive amount of styling options;
- It has a highly customizable interface
- The option of building your own plugins to interact with the model;
- The fact that it is an open source platform.
