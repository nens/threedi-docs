What is the Live Site
==========================

You can load your organization's models and start simulations through `the 3Di Live Site <https://www.3di.live/>`_. During the session, others can follow the simulations live, and interventions can be made in the model during the simulation. Results are presented in real-time. The following :ref:`sections <simulate_w_live_site>` describe all the steps, from adjusting the water input to viewing the calculation results. For an overview of the session screen and tooling, refer to :ref:`overview_screen_ls`.

The video below gives a brief demo of the Livesite:
