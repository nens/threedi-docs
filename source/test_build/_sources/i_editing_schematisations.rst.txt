View and edit a 3Di model schematisation
=========================================

After loading your schematisation, there are several ways to inspect your model. We have added the following features to assist you in viewing and editing the schematisation:

- Multiple styles per layer
- Drop down menus
- Immediate validation
- Automated field fill
- Multi-line fields for time series

Multiple styles per layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The multiple styles per layer can help you when analyzing your model. The different styles depict aspects of the layer you might be interested in, without cluttering your schematisation with too much information at once. 

To switch between stylings: 1) Right click the layer you are interested in. 2) Hold your mouse over styles and the multiple styles will be shown. 3) Click on the style you want to use. The style with the dot next to it is the active style. The figure below shows an example for selecting a style.

Some styles add a label to the object. Keep in mind when using these stylings that the labels only become visible when a certain zoom level is applied. 

The default style depicts the locations of the objects in the layer. The other stylings are explained briefly below:

Drop down menus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have added drop down menus for multiple value attributes in tables. This to assist you in selecting the proper values. The figure below shows an example for selecting a shape for a cross section definition. 

.. figure:: image/d_qgisplugin_vm_dropdown.png
    :width: 25pc
    :height: 25pc
    :alt: Drop down menu example


Immediate validation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For obligatory fields, we have added non-binding constraints. In fields that are correctly, green checks will appear next to the fields after there are filled. An orange cross will appear in case, the field is mandatory, but not filled. 

.. figure:: image/d_qgisplugin_vm_validation.png
    :width: 25pc
    :height: 25pc
    :alt: Validation example


Multi-line fields for time series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multi-line fields are designed for editing time series. In the example of the Figure, the time serie of a discharge boundary condition is edited.

    :width: 50pc
    :height: 25pc
    :alt: Timeseries example

Automated field fill 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some fields are automatically filled to assist in making your schematisation. Here is an overview of the fields that are filled automatically:

- The cross-section location fetches the corresponding channel-id automatically
- Channels and culverts automatically fill connection node ids when drawing between nodes with `snapping <https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/editing_geometry_attributes.html#setting-the-snapping-tolerance-and-search-radius>`_.
- Invert level from culverts. If invert level is empty culverts assumes the invert level based on manhole bottom_level 

On top of that, some default values for some of the mandatory fields are set. This helps you build models faster. The following default values will be set, in case they are left blank. The listed values are defaults, so please change them if required for your specific application.

You need to set your QGIS locale to 'English UnitedStates' in order for this functionality to work properly. See the :ref:`Before you begin > Software <software>` section for instructions.

**Notables:**
The 3Di database has some fields that are not in use. To clean the view, we have hidden them in the form view. They are still available in the database. Moreover, we have made some field names easier to read: for example, prefixes are excluded (e.g. \pipe_).


.. _import_sewerage_data:

Importers for Dutch sewerage data formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3Di has importers for two sewerage data formats: SUF-Hyd and GWSW-HydX. Instructions can be found here: 

* :ref:`import_sufhyd`
* :ref:`import_gwsw_hydx`


.. _addleveebreaches:

Add levee breaches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Levee breaches can be created in 3Di-models that contain a connected *v2_channel* 
(*calculation_type* = 102) and a *v2_levee*-structure. For more information on the 
theory behind levee breaches in 3Di, see :ref:`breaches`.

Before adding levee breaches, please make sure that the data in *v2_levee*-table is 
correctly filled out. For simulating breaches, 3Di requires the *crest_level* of the 
levee in m MSL **(a)**, the *material* of the levee **(b)** and the *max_breach_depth* 
relative to the crest level in meters **(c)**.

**IMPORTANT WARNING:** adding levee breaches should generally be the last step in 
the modelling process. When connected points belonging to a channel are moved 
across a levee in order to simulate a breach, they are assigned a *calculation_pnt_id*
that refers to the id number of the old calculation point. Any changes that affect 
the amount of calculation/connected points or the location of calculation points 
(like adding a new *v2_channel*) will lead to changes in the id numbers of the 
calculation points, and hence, to moved connected points referring to the wrong 
calculation points.

To add levee breaches to your model using the 3Di toolbox, please follow the steps below:

1. Set up a connection with the SQLite or PostgreSQL database of your model (see: :ref:`rasterchecker`).
2. Click on the 3Di toolbox and select *Step 3 - Modify schematisation*.
3. Choose *Predict calc points* and select your SQLite or PostgreSQL model from the list. Two virtual layers will then be added called *v2_connected_pnt* and *v2_calculation_point*.

.. image:: image/d_qgisplugin_leveebreaches_predict_calc_points.png

4. Select the *v2_connected_pnt*-layer in the QGIS *Layers Panel* **(a)** and click on *Select Feature(s)* in the QGIS *Attributes Toolbar* **(b)**. 

.. image:: image/d_qgisplugin_select_cnn_pnt_layer.png

5. Now select the connected points of the channel on which you want to force a levee breach. Selected points will turn yellow.

.. image:: image/d_qgisplugin_select_levee_points.png

6. Next, double-click on *Create breach locations* and a new window will pop-up.

.. image:: image/d_qgisplugin_create_breach_locs.png

7. In the first box **(a)** the *v2_connected_pnt*-layer that was created in Step 3 is auto-selected from a drop-down menu. If it isn't in the list something went wrong in the previous steps.

.. image:: image/d_qgisplugin_create_breach_locs_window.png

8. In the second box **(b)** you enter a search distance in meters. This is the distance perpendicular to the channel that is searched for a *v2_levee*.
9. In the third box **(c)** you enter a number that controls at what distance away from the *v2_levee* the new calculation point is created. **IMPORTANT:** The levee breach will only work if the new calculation point is located in a different calculation cell from that of the original calculation point. Hence, is advised to select a *distance_to_levee* that is larger than the size of the calculation cells in which the levee breach occurs.
10. The *use only selected features* tick box **(d)** should be checked if you want the tool to create breach locations only for the points you selected in the *v2_connected_pnt*-table.
11. The *dry-run* tick box **(e)** can be checked if you first want to create a temporary layer of the moved connected points. This can be useful to compare the original locations with the new locations.
12. When the *auto commit changes* tick box **(f)** is checked, all changes made in the *v2_connected_pnt*-layer are immediately saved. Since these changes can't be reverted and they can be easily saved with the click of one button, we recommended leaving this box unchecked.
13. Click on the *OK*-button **(g)** to create the breach locations. Note that you will still need to save the *v2_connected_pnt*-layer before changes are committed to the model. An example of (not yet committed) connected points that have been moved across a levee to simulate a levee breach, can be seen in the figure below.
