What is the Modeller Interface
===============================

The Modeller Interface is a customized version of QGIS with dedicated :ref:`plugins <overview_plugins>` for the use of 3Di. This interface is used to build schematisations, edit schematisations, start simulations and analyze results.


This video shows the workflow from start to finish of the modelling process:

For an overview of the interface visit the :ref:`mi_overview` page. For more detailed information on the modelling workflow, visit the :ref:`mi_workflow` page. There are also multiple tutorials available on how to work with the Modeller Interface. The basics of the Modeller Interface are explained in the :ref:`Workflow <tutorial1_workflow>` Tutorial.

 
Functionality of the Modeller Interface 
-----------------------------------------

The Modeller Interface makes it easy to:

* Create new schematisations
* Download existing schematisations
* Edit schematisations
* Upload new revisions of a schematisation
* Generate a 3Di model from a schematisation
* Start a simulation
* Download results
* Analyze results

Technical setup
----------------
For instructions on how to install and set up the 3Di Modeller Interface, please refer to the :ref:`installation manual <MI_installation>`. This guide provides step-by-step procedures for installing and configuring the software, ensuring a smooth and trouble-free setup process.


Difference between 3Di Modeller Interface and QGIS
----------------------------------------------------
The Modeller Interface is a customized version of QGIS designed for building 3Di models. Its user interface is specifically tailored for this purpose, and comes with a range of pre-installed plugins to enhance the modeling experience.

We have chosen QGIS as our supporting platform because of the following reasons:

- QGIS comes with hundreds of powerful GIS processing tools;
- It enables the combination of web maps (aerial, topo, osm and may others) and schematisations;
- It offers an extensive amount of styling options;
- It has a highly customizable interface
- The option of building your own plugins to interact with the model;
- The fact that it is an open source platform.
