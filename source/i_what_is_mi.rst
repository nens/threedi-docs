What is the Modeller Interface
===============================

The Modeller Interface is a customized version of QGIS with dedicated :ref:`plugins <overview_plugins>` for the use of 3Di. This interface is used to build :ref:`schematisations <basic_modelling_concepts>`, edit schematisations, start simulations and analyze results.

 
Functionality of the Modeller Interface 
-----------------------------------------

The Modeller Interface makes it easy to:

* Create new schematisations
* Download existing schematisations
* Edit schematisations
* Upload new revisions of a schematisation
* Generate a 3Di model from a schematisation
* Start a simulation
* Download results
* Analyze results

The general workflow is illustrated in this video:

*In this video we present the workflow from start to finish of the new simplified modelling process.*



Technical setup
----------------
For instructions on how to install and set up the 3Di Modeller Interface, please refer to the :ref:`installation manual <MI_installation>`. This guide provides step-by-step procedures for installing and configuring the software, ensuring a smooth and trouble-free setup process.


Difference between 3Di Modeller Interface and QGIS
----------------------------------------------------
The Modeller Interface is a customized version of QGIS designed for building 3Di models. Its user interface is specifically tailored for this purpose, and comes with a range of pre-installed plugins to enhance the modeling experience.
