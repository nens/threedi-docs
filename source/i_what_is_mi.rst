What is the 3Di Modeller Interface
==================================

The 3Di Modeller Interface is the 3Di desktop application. It makes it easy for expert modellers and hydrologists to build and edit 3Di models, run simulations and analyse simulation results to understand water systems and assess flood risks or other hydrological phenomena.

This video shows the workflow from start to finish of the modelling process:
