Using the 3Di Live Site
=========================

Through the 3Di live site (version 2.0) the models of your organisation can be loaded and simulations can be started. During the session others can follow the simulations 'live'. Also interventions can be done in the model during the simulation. Results are presented in real-time. All the steps from adjusting the input of water, to viewing the calculation results are described in this section.

For instructions how to login to and use the 3Di live site see :ref:`guide_to_portal`.
