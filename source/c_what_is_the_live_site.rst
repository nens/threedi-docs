What is the 3Di Live Site
==========================

You can load your organization's models and start simulations through version 2.0 of `the 3Di Live Site <https://www.3di.live/>`_. During the session, others can follow the simulations live, and interventions can be made in the model during the simulation. Results are presented in real-time. The following :ref:`sections <simulate_w_live_site>` describe all the steps, from adjusting the water input to viewing the calculation results.

For instructions on how to log in to the 3Di Live Site, refer to the :ref:`guide_to_portal`. For an overview of the session screen and tooling, refer to :ref:`overview_screen_ls`.
