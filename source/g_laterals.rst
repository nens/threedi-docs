Laterals
=========

Laterals refer in 3Di to point sources and sinks. They can occur in the 1D and in the 2D surface domain. They are treated as any source and sink term, but laterals have a specific location and can vary in time. When one, for example, uses the *tap*-icon in the 3Di Live site, one adds a lateral.  When adding lateral to the 1D and/or the 2D domain, the time series can be added to the related tables in the spatialite database.
