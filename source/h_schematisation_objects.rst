Schematisation objects
======================

A 3Di schematisation consists of rasters, vector layers and settings. This section describes these schematisation objects, their attributes and requirements.

.. note::

   In March 2025, a completely new 3Di database schema was introduced, which means that the names of many layers and their attributes have changed. If you were used to the old database schema, see :ref:`schema_300` for more information.
