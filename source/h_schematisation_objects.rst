Schematisation objects
======================

A 3Di schematisation consists of rasters, vector layers and settings. This section describes these schematisation objects, their attributes and requirements.

.. note::

   We are currently revising the 3Di database schema, i.e. the names of all layers and their attributes. For more information see :ref:`schema_300`.
