=================================
Welcome to the 3Di Documentation!
=================================

Here you can find everything you need to know about the **hydrodynamic modelling software 3Di**.

Introduction
============
3Di is a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulation software, which can be used as modelling tool in water management studies, in both urban as rural areas.
It allows the user to simulate real-world scenarios and make adjustments to them.
This way, water experts can predict and mitigate the impact of pluvial, fluvial and coastal floods, perform climate impact studies and make hydraulic designs of open channel and sewer networks.

3Di distinguishes itself from other hydrodynamic software products because of the option **to model interactively** and **visually**.
For example, it is possible to add or change external forcings (such as rain and wind), breaches and pump capacities during a simulation.
Another very strong aspect of 3Di is the use of **the subgrid technique**. This technique includes high resolution information in coarse resolution computations, without compromising on calculation speed or detail.
Furthermore, it enables **integrated modelling** where overland, channel, sewer, and groundwater flows can be taken included in one calculation.

If you are interested in a **product demo**, a **live** or **online training**, or **becoming a partner**, please visit the `3Di Water Management website <https://3diwatermanagement.com/>`_.

*3Di product overview and example applications*

3Di is a result of a consortium of Stelling Hydraulics, Deltares, TU Delft and Nelen & Schuurmans.
The computational core is developed by Prof. dr. ir. G. S. Stelling, who worked on the subgrid technique in close collaboration with Prof. dr. ir. V. Casulli.
Most of the techniques used within the 3Di computational core are published in scientific papers. 3Di is maintained and further developed by Nelen & Schuurmans.
