Modeller Interface or QGIS
----------------------------

For an overview on the modeller interface go to: :ref:`intro_modeller_interface`

Plugin Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* QGIS 3.16 64bit Long term release (`Get QGIS <http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html#>`_ and use the standalone installer)

    After the installation of QGIS, set the interface language and locale to American English. This makes it easier to understand the instructions in this documentation. Some locales do not support scientific notations of numbers, these are required for very small numbers (e.g. 1e-09).

    * Go to Settings > Options > General
    * Tick the box 'Override System Locale'
    * For User Interface Translation, choose 'American English'
    * For Locale, choose 'English UnitedStates (en_US)'
    * Restart QGIS

* QGiS 3Di plug-in specially designed for 3Di
	
	* 3Di Toolbox
