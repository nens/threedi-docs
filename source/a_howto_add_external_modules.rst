How to add external modules
===========================

External modules in 3Di are developed to add extra features to your model which are apart from the direct hydrodynamics. Currently, only water quality is implemented as external module. In the future als morphodynamics will be implemented as external module in 3Di. In this section will be explained how these external modules can be implemented in your simulation.  

Water Quality
-----------------------------

This external module can be added if you want to calculate the water quality in your model. The technical functioning of this module is explained in :ref:`water_quality`. At this point waterquality can only be added through the use of the 3Di api.
