3Di Models and Simulations Plugin
==================================

The 3Di Models and Simulations plugin consists of two parts: :ref:`models_simulation_settings` and :ref:`models_simulation_panel`. An overview for each of these is given below.

.. note:: 
   The plugin comes pre-installed with the Modeller Interface. But when you use the plugin for the first time you need to set it up. Follow these :ref:`instructions <setting_up_models_and_simulations>` to do this.


Functionality
--------------

With this plugin, you can:

* Create new schematisations.
* Generate a 3Di model based on a schematisation.
* Edit existing schematisations.
* Download and access existing schematisations.
* Upload new revisions of a schematisation.
* Initiate simulations.
* Download simulation results.
* Analyze and interpret simulation results.

* **Base API URL:** The Base API URL is in most cases https://api.3di.live.
* **Uploads processing timeout:** 
* **Working directory:** Set the local working directory. In this directory all your schematisations and results will be stored.
* **API Key:** Set you personal API Key. Click :ref:`here <setting_up_models_and_simulations>` for more information on how to obtain one.
* **Use defaults:** Sets the default Base API URL, Uploads processing timeout and Working directory


.. VRAAG: kloppen deze knoppen? wat doet de uploads processing timeout?
