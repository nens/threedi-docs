3Di Models & Simulations API
============================

Our `REST API <https://api.3di.live/v3/>`_ allows scripts and software applications to interact with all 3Di online resources and services.

This gives you a lot of flexibility to your modelling applications and can save you lots of manual work and time. Some examples of applications of the API are:

- Batch simulations: run simulations with hundreds of different rain events.
- Automated test runs, results checks and adjustments to a model before running another simulation.
- Run 3Di in an operational system, such as a Flood Early Warning System.
- Use Jupyter Notebooks to run, download and analyze your 3Di simulations.
- Design your own control for weirs or other structures.

See the separate 3Di API `documentation <https://api.3di.live/v3.0/docs/>`_ for more details. 

Using the 3Di API from Python is easy using `threedi-api-client <https://pypi.org/project/threedi-api-client/>`_.

An overview of the endpoints (and their documentation) can be found on the `Swagger page <https://api.3di.live/v3/swagger/>`_.

Additional example scripts can be found in `here <https://github.com/threedi/scripts-nens/tree/master/Notebooks%203Di%20-%20API%20v3%20-%20VD>`_.
