3Di documentation
=================

Let's try to do it with restructuredtext/sphinx!

The documentation (open source!) is automatically build on
http://3di-documentation.readthedocs.io, we can change the URL later on.


Local setup
-----------

If you can run docker, you're in luck. One-time setup::

  $ docker-compose build

And then every time you want to re-generate your documentation::

  $ docker-compose build

If you're not so lucky, you'll need to pip-install sphinx and you need latex
(see the `Dockerfile` for the short list of packages that we install).

Commits are automatically tested on jenkins:
https://jenkins.lizard.net/blue/organizations/jenkins/nens%2Fthreedi-docs/


Special commands
----------------

If the sphinx documentation tells you about a makefile: you can run those
commands from within docker, too. For example::

  $ docker-compose run builder make latexpdf


Make html and auto rebuild when files are changed::

  $ make livehtml


Some sphinx/restructuredtext notes
----------------------------------

You'll need to learn a bit of restructuredtext:
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html

Special stuff, cross-references, indices etc:
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/index.html

Math support ("it is all LaTeX"):
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/math.html


Any questions: ask Reinout.


Some commands needed for the OSGEO4W Shell with sphinx
------------------------------------------------------

From the git directory run the following commands::

    pip install sphinx
    sphinx-build threedi-docs\source build

You will recieve some warnings, check them. You are not able to evaluate LateX
formulas this way.


Making a release
----------------

Only released versions are shown publicly on readthedocs. To make a release,
install zest.releaser::

  $ pip install zest.releaser

(It is also installed inside the docker, but your git credentials won't work
in there.)

Make a release by running::

  $ fullrelease

You can normally answer all the questions with <enter>.
